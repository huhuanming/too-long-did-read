## English

Chris Liddell has been appointed to Anthropic's Board of Directors. He brings over 30 years of senior leadership experience across some of the world's largest and most complex organizations to the role. He previously served as Chief Financial Officer of Microsoft, General Motors, and International Paper, as well as the Deputy White House Chief of Staff during President Trump's first term.

"Chris has spent his career at the intersection of technology, public service, and governance—and has a track record of helping organizations get those things right when the stakes are highest," said Daniela Amodei, Co-founder and President of Anthropic. "As AI's impact on society grows, that kind of judgement and experience is exactly what we seek on our board."

Liddell joins Dario Amodei, Daniela Amodei, Yasmin Razavi, Jay Kreps, and Reed Hastings on Anthropic's Board of Directors. Anthropic is a Public Benefit Corporation and its Board is elected by stockholders and the Long-Term Benefit Trust.

"My career has taught me the governance of transformative technologies matters as much as the technologies themselves," said Chris Liddell. "Anthropic's approach—building AI that's both capable and responsible—is critical for our future, and it's why I'm proud to be joining the company's Board."

Liddell currently serves as a Director of both Commonwealth Fusion Systems and the Council on Foreign Relations. He has also been involved in several presidential transition teams, has written a book on that topic, and was the Director of the American Technology Council in the White House, focused on modernizing government technology.

Beyond his corporate and public service career, Liddell has been recognized for his contributions to business and philanthropy. He currently serves as Chairman of New Zealand's largest environmental foundation and has sat on several nonprofit boards, including the New Zealand Rugby Union. In 2016, he was appointed a Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit for services to business and philanthropy.
