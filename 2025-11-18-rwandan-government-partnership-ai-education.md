## English

Anthropic is announcing a new partnership with the Government of Rwanda and African tech training provider ALX to bring Chidi—a learning companion built on Claude—to hundreds of thousands of learners across Africa. Rwanda's ICT & Innovation and Education ministries are deploying Chidi within their national education system, while ALX will bring the tool to students across the continent.

With this initiative, university graduates and young professionals in countries across Africa will be able to use Chidi to learn new skills, like data analytics or cloud computing. And teachers in Rwanda can use it to plan lessons and help them support their students.

### Partnering with the Government of Rwanda

The government will enable AI training for up to 2,000 teachers, as well as civil servants across the country. Graduates will receive a year of access to Claude tools, including Claude Pro for individuals and Claude Code for developer teams in government.

Paula Ingabire, Minister of ICT & Innovation in Rwanda, stated: "Rwanda's Vision 2050 places youth and technology at the core of national progress, and our goal is to build a workforce equipped for the opportunities of the 21st century."

### Building Skills with AI Across the Continent

Beyond Rwanda, ALX is deploying Chidi across its technology training programs throughout Africa. As one of the continent's largest technology training providers, ALX reaches over 200,000 students and young professionals. Chidi serves as a "Socratic mentor"—guiding learners through thoughtful questions, rather than providing direct answers.

Early results: since the tool was rolled out on November 4, learners have engaged in over 1,100 conversations and nearly 4,000 learning sessions, with nine out of ten users reporting positive experiences.

Fred Swaniker, Founder and CEO of ALX, stated: "This is not just about bringing technology to Africa; it's about co-creating the future of learning to unlock the continent's full potential."

### Expanding AI for Public Good Worldwide

Today's announcement builds upon education partnerships reshaping how students and educators interact with AI worldwide. In Iceland, Anthropic launched one of the world's first comprehensive national AI education pilots. The London School of Economics has provided all students with access to Claude for Education.

## 中文翻译

Anthropic 宣布与卢旺达政府和非洲科技培训提供商 ALX 建立新的合作伙伴关系，将 Chidi——一个基于 Claude 构建的学习伴侣——带给非洲数十万学习者。卢旺达的 ICT 与创新部和教育部正在其国家教育系统中部署 Chidi，而 ALX 将把该工具带给整个大陆的学生。

通过这一倡议，非洲各国的大学毕业生和年轻专业人士将能够使用 Chidi 学习新技能，如数据分析或云计算。卢旺达的教师可以用它来备课并帮助他们支持学生。

### 与卢旺达政府合作

政府将为多达 2,000 名教师以及全国的公务员提供 AI 培训。毕业生将获得一年的 Claude 工具访问权限，包括个人用的 Claude Pro 和政府开发团队用的 Claude Code。

卢旺达 ICT 与创新部长 Paula Ingabire 表示："卢旺达的 2050 愿景将青年和技术置于国家进步的核心，我们的目标是建设一支能够抓住 21 世纪机遇的劳动力队伍。"

### 在整个大陆培养 AI 技能

在卢旺达之外，ALX 正在非洲各地的技术培训项目中部署 Chidi。作为非洲大陆最大的技术培训提供商之一，ALX 覆盖超过 20 万名学生和年轻专业人士。Chidi 充当"苏格拉底式导师"——通过深思熟虑的问题引导学习者，而不是提供直接答案。

早期成果：自 11 月 4 日推出该工具以来，学习者已参与了超过 1,100 次对话和近 4,000 次学习会话，十分之九的用户报告了积极的体验。

ALX 创始人兼 CEO Fred Swaniker 表示："这不仅仅是将技术带到非洲；而是共同创造学习的未来，释放大陆的全部潜力。"

### 在全球范围内扩展公益 AI

今天的公告建立在重塑全球学生和教育工作者与 AI 互动方式的教育合作伙伴关系之上。在冰岛，Anthropic 推出了世界上首批全面的国家级 AI 教育试点之一。伦敦政治经济学院已向所有学生提供 Claude for Education 的访问权限。
