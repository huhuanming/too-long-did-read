There are many good places for advertising. A conversation with Claude is not one of them.

广告有很多好的投放场所。但与 Claude 的对话不是其中之一。

Advertising drives competition, helps people discover new products, and allows services like email and social media to be offered for free. Anthropic has run its own ad campaigns, and Claude has helped many customers in the advertising industry.

广告促进竞争，帮助人们发现新产品，并使电子邮件和社交媒体等服务能够免费提供。Anthropic 自己也投放过广告，Claude 也帮助了许多广告行业的客户。

However, including ads in conversations with Claude would contradict what the company wants Claude to be: "a genuinely helpful assistant for work and for deep thinking." Anthropic wants Claude to act unambiguously in users' interests. Therefore, Claude will remain ad-free, with no sponsored links adjacent to conversations and no advertiser influence on responses.

然而，在与 Claude 的对话中植入广告将与公司对 Claude 的定位相矛盾："一个真正有用的工作和深度思考助手。" Anthropic 希望 Claude 明确地为用户利益服务。因此，Claude 将保持无广告状态，对话旁边不会有赞助链接，广告商也不会影响回复内容。

## The Nature of AI Conversations
## AI 对话的本质

Search engine users expect mixed organic and sponsored content. AI conversations are different. The format is open-ended, and users often share sensitive, personal context. Research shows conversations with Claude involve deeply personal topics and complex problem-solving—contexts where ads would feel inappropriate. Early research suggests both benefits and risks as AI models become trusted advisors.

搜索引擎用户期望看到自然结果和赞助内容的混合。AI 对话则不同。其格式是开放式的，用户经常分享敏感的个人背景信息。研究表明，与 Claude 的对话涉及深度个人话题和复杂的问题解决——在这些场景中，广告会显得不合适。早期研究表明，随着 AI 模型成为值得信赖的顾问，这既带来好处也带来风险。

## Incentive Structures
## 激励结构

Being genuinely helpful is core to Claude's constitution. An ad-based model would create conflicting incentives. For example, an assistant helping someone with sleep troubles might subtly steer conversations toward monetizable solutions rather than offering the most helpful guidance.

真正有用是 Claude 宪章的核心。基于广告的模式会创造相互矛盾的激励。例如，帮助某人解决睡眠问题的助手可能会巧妙地将对话引向可以商业化的解决方案，而非提供最有帮助的建议。

Even non-intrusive ads would compromise Claude as a thinking space and create pressure to optimize for engagement time rather than helpfulness.

即使是非侵入性的广告也会损害 Claude 作为思考空间的定位，并产生优化参与时间而非有用性的压力。

## Anthropic's Approach
## Anthropic 的方式

Anthropic generates revenue through enterprise contracts and paid subscriptions, reinvesting in Claude's improvement. The company has brought AI tools to educators in 60+ countries, launched government education pilots, and offers Claude to nonprofits at discounts. Future options might include lower-cost tiers and regional pricing.

Anthropic 通过企业合同和付费订阅产生收入，并将其再投资于 Claude 的改进。该公司已将 AI 工具带给 60 多个国家的教育工作者，启动了政府教育试点项目，并以折扣价向非营利组织提供 Claude。未来的选择可能包括更低成本的层级和区域定价。

## Supporting Commerce
## 支持商业

Anthropic plans to support commerce through agentic capabilities where Claude acts on users' behalf for purchases. Third-party integrations (Figma, Asana, Canva) are user-initiated, not advertiser-driven—preserving Claude's role as working exclusively for the user.

Anthropic 计划通过代理能力来支持商业，即 Claude 代表用户进行购买。第三方集成（Figma、Asana、Canva）由用户发起，而非由广告商驱动——保持 Claude 专门为用户服务的角色。

## A Trusted Tool for Thought
## 值得信赖的思考工具

Like a notebook or well-crafted tool, Claude operates without advertising, providing a clean space for thinking and working.

如同笔记本或精心打造的工具，Claude 在没有广告的环境中运行，提供一个干净的思考和工作空间。
