## English

Anthropic has been selected by the UK's Department for Science, Innovation and Technology (DSIT) to help build and pilot a dedicated AI-powered assistant for GOV.UK. The AI assistant will help people navigate government services and give tailored advice. The initial use case is employment: helping people find work, access training, understand the support and resources available, and more.

This builds on the Memorandum of Understanding Anthropic signed in February 2025 with the UK government to explore how advanced AI could transform public services for UK citizens.

### AI for UK government services that puts safety first

Since signing the MOU, Anthropic and DSIT have been collaborating on how to bring AI into government services safely and effectively. The GOV.UK AI assistant, powered by Claude, is one of the first major outcomes of that work. It's an agentic system designed to go beyond answering questions—actively guiding people through government processes with individually-tailored support.

"We're excited to partner with the UK government to help deliver on the AI Opportunities Action Plan," commented Pip White, Head of UK, Ireland and Northern Europe. "This partnership with the UK government is central to our mission. It demonstrates how frontier AI can be deployed safely for the public benefit, setting the standard for how governments integrate AI into the services their citizens depend on."

A central goal of this partnership is building AI and AI safety expertise within the UK government. Anthropic engineers will work alongside civil servants and software developers at the Government Digital Service throughout the engagement, with the goal of ensuring the UK government can independently maintain the system.

### Helping more people find work in the UK

The AI assistant for GOV.UK will initially focus on supporting job seekers entering or re-entering the workforce. It will provide personalized career advice, help people access training, explain supports, and intelligently route people to the right services based on individual circumstances. It will also maintain context across interactions, so people don't have to start from scratch each time they return. Users will have full control over their data—including what's remembered, and the ability to opt out at any time—with all personal information handled in line with UK data protection law.

The project follows DSIT's "Scan, Pilot, Scale" framework, a deliberate, phased approach that allows government and Anthropic to test, learn, and iterate before wider rollout.

### Our commitment to the UK's leadership in AI

This partnership reflects Anthropic's broader and growing investment in the United Kingdom. The London office houses a growing team of AI researchers and continues expanding with functions including go-to-market, applied AI, policy and more.

This initiative with DSIT is part of a growing trend of governments and organizations partnering with Anthropic to deploy AI for public benefit. In Iceland, Anthropic has partnered with the Ministry of Education and Children to launch one of the world's first national AI education pilots. Anthropic has also recently partnered with the Rwandan Government to bring AI education to hundreds of thousands of learners across the country.

## 中文翻译

Anthropic 已被英国科学、创新和技术部 (DSIT) 选中，帮助构建和试点一个专用的 AI 驱动助手，服务于 GOV.UK。该 AI 助手将帮助人们导航政府服务并提供定制建议。初始用例是就业：帮助人们找工作、获得培训、了解可用的支持和资源等。

这建立在 Anthropic 于 2025 年 2 月与英国政府签署的谅解备忘录基础上，旨在探索先进 AI 如何改变英国公民的公共服务。

### 以安全为先的英国政府服务 AI

自签署谅解备忘录以来，Anthropic 和 DSIT 一直在合作探索如何安全有效地将 AI 引入政府服务。由 Claude 驱动的 GOV.UK AI 助手是这项工作的首个重大成果之一。它是一个智能体系统，旨在超越回答问题——以个性化的支持主动引导人们完成政府流程。

英国、爱尔兰和北欧负责人 Pip White 评论道："我们很高兴与英国政府合作，帮助实现 AI 机遇行动计划。这一合作展示了前沿 AI 如何安全地为公共利益部署，为政府如何将 AI 集成到公民依赖的服务中树立了标准。"

该合作的核心目标是在英国政府内部建立 AI 和 AI 安全专业知识。Anthropic 的工程师将在整个合作过程中与政府数字服务部的公务员和软件开发人员一起工作，目标是确保英国政府能够独立维护该系统。

### 帮助更多人在英国找到工作

GOV.UK 的 AI 助手最初将专注于支持进入或重新进入劳动力市场的求职者。它将提供个性化的职业建议，帮助人们获得培训，解释支持措施，并根据个人情况智能地将人们引导到正确的服务。它还将在交互之间保持上下文，这样人们每次返回时不必从头开始。用户将完全控制自己的数据——包括记住什么以及随时选择退出的能力——所有个人信息都按照英国数据保护法处理。

该项目遵循 DSIT 的"扫描、试点、扩展"框架，这是一种深思熟虑的分阶段方法，允许政府和 Anthropic 在更广泛推出之前进行测试、学习和迭代。

### 我们对英国 AI 领导力的承诺

这一合作反映了 Anthropic 在英国日益增长的投资。伦敦办公室拥有一个不断壮大的 AI 研究团队，并继续扩展包括市场推广、应用 AI、政策等职能。

这一与 DSIT 的倡议是政府和组织与 Anthropic 合作部署 AI 为公共利益服务这一日益增长趋势的一部分。在冰岛，Anthropic 与教育和儿童部合作推出了世界上首批国家级 AI 教育试点之一。Anthropic 还最近与卢旺达政府合作，将 AI 教育带给该国数十万学习者。
