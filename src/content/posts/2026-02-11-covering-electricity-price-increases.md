## English

As we continue to invest in American AI infrastructure, Anthropic will cover electricity price increases that consumers face from our data centers.

Training a single frontier AI model will soon require gigawatts of power, and the US AI sector will need at least 50 gigawatts of capacity over the next several years. The country needs to build new data centers quickly to maintain its competitiveness on AI and national security—but AI companies shouldn't leave American ratepayers to pick up the tab.

Data centers can raise consumer electricity prices in two main ways. First, connecting data centers to the grid often requires costly new or upgraded infrastructure like transmission lines or substations. Second, new demand tightens the market, pushing up prices. We're committing to address both. Specifically, we will:

**Cover grid infrastructure costs.** We will pay for 100% of the grid upgrades needed to interconnect our data centers, paid through increases to our monthly electricity charges. This includes the shares of these costs that would otherwise be passed onto consumers.

**Procure new power and protect consumers from price increases.** We will work to bring net-new power generation online to match our data centers' electricity needs. Where new generation isn't online, we'll work with utilities and external experts to estimate and cover demand-driven price effects from our data centers.

**Reduce strain on the grid.** We're investing in curtailment systems that cut our data centers' power usage during periods of peak demand, as well as grid optimization tools, both of which help keep prices lower for ratepayers.

**Invest in local communities.** Our current data center projects will create hundreds of permanent jobs and thousands of construction jobs. We're also committed to being a responsible neighbor—that means addressing environmental impacts, including deploying water-efficient cooling technologies, and partnering with local leaders on initiatives that share AI's benefits broadly.

Where we work with partners to develop data centers for handling our own workloads, we make these commitments directly. Where we lease capacity from existing data centers, we're exploring further ways to address our own workloads' effects on prices.

Of course, company-level action isn't enough. Keeping electricity affordable also requires systemic change. We support federal policies—including permitting reform and efforts to speed up transmission development and grid interconnection—that make it faster and cheaper to bring new energy online for everyone.

Done right, AI infrastructure can be a catalyst for the broader energy investment the country needs. These commitments are the beginning of our efforts to address data centers' impact on energy costs. We have more to do, and we'll continue to share updates as this work develops.

在我们继续投资美国 AI 基础设施的同时，Anthropic 将承担消费者因我们的数据中心而面临的电价上涨。

训练单个前沿 AI 模型很快将需要吉瓦级的电力，美国 AI 行业在未来几年将需要至少 50 吉瓦的容量。国家需要快速建设新的数据中心以维持其在 AI 和国家安全方面的竞争力——但 AI 公司不应让美国电力用户来买单。

数据中心可以通过两种主要方式提高消费者电价。首先，将数据中心连接到电网通常需要昂贵的新建或升级基础设施，如输电线路或变电站。其次，新增需求收紧市场，推高价格。我们承诺解决这两个问题。具体而言，我们将：

**承担电网基础设施成本。** 我们将支付 100% 的电网升级费用，用于数据中心的互联，通过增加我们的月度电费来支付。这包括本应转嫁给消费者的那部分成本。

**采购新电力并保护消费者免受价格上涨影响。** 我们将努力使新的净增发电能力上线，以匹配数据中心的电力需求。在新发电能力尚未上线的地方，我们将与公用事业公司和外部专家合作，估算并承担数据中心的需求驱动价格效应。

**减轻电网压力。** 我们正在投资削减系统，在高峰需求期间减少数据中心的用电量，以及电网优化工具，这两者都有助于降低电力用户的价格。

**投资当地社区。** 我们目前的数据中心项目将创造数百个永久性工作岗位和数千个建筑工作岗位。我们还致力于成为负责任的邻居——这意味着解决环境影响，包括部署节水冷却技术，以及与当地领导人合作开展广泛分享 AI 好处的倡议。

当然，公司层面的行动是不够的。保持电力可负担性还需要系统性变革。我们支持联邦政策——包括许可改革和加快输电发展和电网互联的努力——使每个人更快、更便宜地获得新能源。

做得好的话，AI 基础设施可以成为国家所需的更广泛能源投资的催化剂。这些承诺是我们解决数据中心对能源成本影响的开始。
