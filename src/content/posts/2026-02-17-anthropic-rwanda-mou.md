## English

The Government of Rwanda and Anthropic have formalized a three-year partnership through a Memorandum of Understanding that expands AI integration into Rwanda's education, health, and public sector systems. This agreement builds on a previous educational collaboration announced in November 2025 and represents Anthropic's first formalized multi-sector government partnership on the African continent.

### Three Core Collaboration Areas

**Health Sector Support:** Anthropic will assist Rwanda's Ministry of Health in achieving national health objectives, including efforts to eliminate cervical cancer and reduce malaria and maternal mortality rates.

**Public Sector Developer Access:** Government development teams will gain access to Claude and Claude Code tools. The partnership includes hands-on training, capacity building support, and API credits to facilitate broader AI integration across government institutions.

**Education Partnership Expansion:** The MOU formally establishes the fall 2025 education agreement, which provided 2,000 Claude Pro licenses for Rwandan educators, AI literacy training for public servants, and deployment of a Claude-powered learning companion across eight African nations.

### Strategic Commentary

Paula Ingabire, Rwanda's Minister of Information and Communications Technology and Innovation, stated the partnership supports Rwanda's goal to "design and deploy AI solutions that can be applied at a national level to strengthen education, advance health outcomes, and enhance governance."

Elizabeth Kelly, Head of Beneficial Deployments at Anthropic, emphasized that "Technology is only as valuable as its reach," highlighting investments in training and capacity building.

### Partnership Philosophy

The collaboration prioritizes capacity building, responsible deployment, and local decision-making authority over technology adoption. The partnership aims to build sustainable institutional foundations for AI's positive impact on education, health, and governance sectors.

## 中文翻译

卢旺达政府和 Anthropic 通过一份谅解备忘录正式建立了为期三年的合作伙伴关系，将 AI 整合扩展到卢旺达的教育、健康和公共部门系统中。该协议建立在 2025 年 11 月宣布的此前教育合作基础上，代表着 Anthropic 在非洲大陆的第一个正式多部门政府合作伙伴关系。

### 三个核心合作领域

**健康部门支持：** Anthropic 将协助卢旺达卫生部实现国家健康目标，包括消除宫颈癌以及降低疟疾和孕产妇死亡率的努力。

**公共部门开发者访问：** 政府开发团队将获得 Claude 和 Claude Code 工具的访问权限。该合作伙伴关系包括实践培训、能力建设支持和 API 积分，以促进政府机构更广泛地整合 AI。

**教育合作扩展：** 该谅解备忘录正式确立了 2025 年秋季的教育协议，该协议为卢旺达教育工作者提供了 2,000 个 Claude Pro 许可证、为公务员提供 AI 素养培训，以及在八个非洲国家部署由 Claude 驱动的学习伴侣。

### 战略评论

卢旺达信息和通信技术与创新部长 Paula Ingabire 表示，该合作伙伴关系支持卢旺达"设计和部署可在国家层面应用的 AI 解决方案，以加强教育、改善健康成果和提升治理"的目标。

Anthropic 有益部署负责人 Elizabeth Kelly 强调"技术的价值取决于其覆盖范围"，并突出了在培训和能力建设方面的投资。

### 合作理念

该合作优先考虑能力建设、负责任的部署和地方决策权，而非单纯的技术采用。合作伙伴关系旨在为 AI 在教育、健康和治理部门产生积极影响建立可持续的制度基础。
