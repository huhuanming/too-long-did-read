## English

Irina Ghose is joining Anthropic as Managing Director of India as the company prepares to open its first office in the country.

Ghose brings more than three decades of experience scaling technology businesses. She most recently served as Managing Director at Microsoft India, where she spearheaded enterprise AI adoption across major Indian industries including banking and financial services, healthcare, manufacturing, and government. Throughout her career, she has led high-impact teams, built ecosystem partnerships, and championed future-ready capabilities across India's technology landscape with consistent focus on leveraging technology for meaningful business and societal impact.

"India has a real opportunity to shape how AI is built and deployed at scale," Ghose stated. "Indian organizations are moving beyond experimentation toward applied AI, where trust, safety, and long-term impact matter as much as innovation. Anthropic's mission resonates with my belief that technology should empower people, expand access, and create lasting value across India's diverse languages and communities."

Chris Ciauri, Managing Director of International at Anthropic, commented: "Irina's expertise in scaling technology businesses and driving enterprise transformation makes her the ideal leader as we expand. As we grow our teams and deepen engagement across India's public and private sectors, Irina will ensure our approach is grounded in local insight and aligned with our mission."

The India team will collaborate with policymakers and academic institutions, strengthen developer engagement, and establish partnerships with enterprises and organizations using AI to address local challenges.

India ranks as the second-largest market globally for Claude.ai. Anthropic's fourth Economic Index revealed that Indian users demonstrate striking focus on technical applications, with nearly half of all Claude.ai usage concentrated in computer and mathematical tasks.
