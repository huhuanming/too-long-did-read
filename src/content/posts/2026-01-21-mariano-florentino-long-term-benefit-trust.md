## English

Anthropic's Long-Term Benefit Trust has announced the appointment of Mariano-Florentino (Tino) Cuéllar as a new member. The Trust operates as "an independent body designed to help Anthropic achieve its public benefit mission."

Cuéllar brings extensive professional credentials including service as a California Supreme Court Justice, leadership of Stanford's Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies, and current role as Carnegie Endowment for International Peace President. He announced plans to step down from Carnegie in July 2026, returning to Stanford to lead the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences and the Knight-Hennessy Scholars Program.

His background encompasses three U.S. presidential administrations and chairmanship of the William & Flora Hewlett Foundation board. Shaped by U.S.-Mexico border upbringing, his career spans immigration, criminal justice, public health, and regulatory reform. He co-led California's Working Group on AI Frontier Models alongside Fei-Fei Li and served on the National Academy of Sciences Committee on Social and Ethical Implications of Computing Research.

Neil Buddy Shah, Trust Chair, emphasized: "As AI becomes a defining factor in geopolitical competition—reshaping economies, security, and the balance of power between nations—the Trust needs leaders who understand these dynamics."

Anthropic, operating as a Public Benefit Corporation with a mission of "ensuring a safe transition through transformative AI," uses the Trust to select Board Directors and advise leadership on maximizing AI benefits while mitigating risks. Trustees have no financial stake in Anthropic, with composition reflecting recognition that transformative AI affects global health, international security, and society broadly.

Cuéllar stated: "As AI capabilities advance at an unprecedented pace, the need for governance structures that marry private sector dynamism with civic responsibility has never been more urgent."

The Trust announced that Kanika Bahl and Zachary Robinson concluded their trustee terms, having joined at the Trust's founding in 2023 and contributed to establishing its governance role.

Daniela Amodei, Anthropic President, praised Cuéllar's "ability to work across sectors—law, government, academia, and technology," noting the need for leaders deeply versed in technology's societal implications.

## 中文翻译

Anthropic 的长期利益信托宣布任命 Mariano-Florentino (Tino) Cuéllar 为新成员。该信托作为"一个旨在帮助 Anthropic 实现其公益使命的独立机构"运作。

Cuéllar 拥有丰富的专业资历，包括担任加利福尼亚最高法院法官、领导斯坦福大学 Freeman Spogli 国际研究所，以及目前担任卡内基国际和平基金会主席。他宣布计划于 2026 年 7 月辞去卡内基的职务，返回斯坦福大学领导行为科学高等研究中心和 Knight-Hennessy 学者项目。

他的背景涵盖三届美国总统政府和 William & Flora Hewlett 基金会董事会主席。在美墨边境成长的经历塑造了他，其职业生涯跨越移民、刑事司法、公共卫生和监管改革领域。他与李飞飞共同领导了加利福尼亚 AI 前沿模型工作组，并在美国国家科学院计算研究的社会和伦理影响委员会任职。

信托主席 Neil Buddy Shah 强调："随着 AI 成为地缘政治竞争的决定性因素——重塑经济、安全和国家间的力量平衡——信托需要理解这些动态的领导者。"

Anthropic 作为一家使命为"确保安全过渡到变革性 AI"的公益公司运营，利用该信托选择董事会成员，并就最大化 AI 利益同时降低风险向领导层提供建议。受托人在 Anthropic 没有财务利益，其组成反映了对变革性 AI 影响全球健康、国际安全和整个社会的认识。

Cuéllar 表示："随着 AI 能力以前所未有的速度进步，将私营部门的活力与公民责任相结合的治理结构的需求从未如此迫切。"

信托宣布 Kanika Bahl 和 Zachary Robinson 结束了他们的受托人任期，他们于 2023 年信托成立时加入，并为建立其治理角色做出了贡献。

Anthropic 总裁 Daniela Amodei 赞扬了 Cuéllar "跨部门工作的能力——法律、政府、学术界和技术"，并指出需要深谙技术社会影响的领导者。
