**Preface**

*What if our AI bullishness continues to be right...and what if that's actually bearish?*

**What follows is a scenario, not a prediction.** This isn't bear porn or AI doomer fan-fiction. The sole intent of this piece is modeling a scenario that's been relatively underexplored. Our friend Alap Shah posed the question, and together we brainstormed the answer. We wrote this part, and he's written two others you can find [here](https://open.substack.com/pub/alapshah1/p/the-global-intelligence-crisis?r=1g6uar&utm_campaign=post&utm_medium=web&showWelcomeOnShare=true).

Hopefully, reading this leaves you more prepared for potential left tail risks as AI makes the economy increasingly weird.

**This is the CitriniResearch Macro Memo from June 2028, detailing the progression and fallout of the Global Intelligence Crisis.**

### The Consequences of Abundant Intelligence

*CitriniResearch*

*February 22nd, 2026 / June 30th, 2028*

The unemployment rate printed 10.2% this morning, a 0.3% upside surprise. The market sold off 2% on the number, bringing the cumulative drawdown in the S&P to 38% from its October 2026 highs.

Traders have grown numb. Six months ago, a print like this would have triggered a circuit breaker.

**Two years.** That's all it took to get from "contained" and "sector-specific" to an economy that no longer resembles the one any of us grew up in. This quarter's macro memo is our attempt to reconstruct the sequence - a post-mortem on the pre-crisis economy.

The euphoria was palpable. By October 2026, the S&P 500 flirted with 8000, the Nasdaq broke above 30k. The initial wave of layoffs due to human obsolescence began in early 2026, and they did exactly what layoffs are supposed to. Margins expanded, earnings beat, stocks rallied. Record-setting corporate profits were funneled right back into AI compute.

The headline numbers were still great. Nominal GDP repeatedly printed mid-to-high single-digit annualized growth. Productivity was booming. Real output per hour rose at rates not seen since the 1950s, driven by AI agents that don't sleep, take sick days or require health insurance.

The owners of compute saw their wealth explode as labor costs vanished. Meanwhile, real wage growth collapsed. Despite the administration's repeated boasts of record productivity, white-collar workers lost jobs to machines and were forced into lower-paying roles.

When cracks began appearing in the consumer economy, economic pundits popularized the phrase "*Ghost GDP*": output that shows up in the national accounts but never circulates through the real economy.

*In every way AI was exceeding expectations, and the market was AI.* The only problem…**the economy was not.**

It should have been clear all along that a single GPU cluster in North Dakota generating the output previously attributed to 10,000 white-collar workers in midtown Manhattan is more economic pandemic than economic panacea. The velocity of money flatlined. The human-centric consumer economy, 70% of GDP at the time, withered. We probably could have figured this out sooner if we just asked how much money machines spend on discretionary goods. (Hint: it's zero.)

AI capabilities improved, companies needed fewer workers, white collar layoffs increased, displaced workers spent less, margin pressure pushed firms to invest more in AI, AI capabilities improved…

It was a negative feedback loop with no natural brake. The *human intelligence displacement spiral*. White-collar workers saw their earnings power (and, rationally, their spending) structurally impaired. Their incomes were the bedrock of the $13 trillion mortgage market - forcing underwriters to reassess whether prime mortgages are still money good.

Seventeen years without a real default cycle had left privates bloated with PE-backed software deals that assumed ARR would remain recurring. The first wave of defaults due to AI disruption in mid-2027 challenged that assumption.

This would have been manageable if the disruption remained contained to software, but it didn't. By the end of 2027, it threatened every business model predicated on intermediation. Swaths of companies built on monetizing friction for humans disintegrated.

The system turned out to be one long daisy chain of correlated bets on white-collar productivity growth. The November 2027 crash only served to accelerate all of the negative feedback loops already in place.

We've been waiting for "bad news is good news" for almost a year now. The government is starting to consider proposals, but public faith in the ability of the government to stage any sort of rescue has dwindled. Policy response has always lagged economic reality, but lack of a comprehensive plan is now threatening to accelerate a deflationary spiral.

### How It Started

In late 2025, agentic coding tools took a step function jump in capability.

A competent developer working with Claude Code or Codex could now replicate the core functionality of a mid-market SaaS product in weeks. Not perfectly or with every edge case handled, but well enough that the CIO reviewing a $500k annual renewal started asking the question "what if we just built this ourselves?"

Fiscal years mostly line up with calendar years, so 2026 enterprise spend had been set in Q4 2025, when "agentic AI" was still a buzzword. The mid-year review was the first time procurement teams were making decisions with visibility into what these systems could actually do. Some watched their own internal teams spin up prototypes replicating six-figure SaaS contracts in weeks.

That summer, we spoke with a procurement manager at a Fortune 500. He told us about one of his budget negotiations. The salesperson had expected to run the same playbook as last year: a 5% annual price increase, the standard "your team depends on us" pitch. The procurement manager told him he'd been in conversations with OpenAI about having their "forward deployed engineers" use AI tools to replace the vendor entirely. They renewed at a 30% discount. That was a good outcome, he said. The "long-tail of SaaS", like Monday.com, Zapier and Asana, had it much worse.

Investors were prepared - expectant, even - that the long tail would be hit hard. They may have made up a third of spending for the typical enterprise stack, but they were obviously exposed. The systems of record, however, were supposed to be safe from disruption.

It wasn't until ServiceNow's Q3 26 report that the mechanism of reflexivity became clearer.

> SERVICENOW NET NEW ACV GROWTH DECELERATES TO 14% FROM 23%; ANNOUNCES 15% WORKFORCE REDUCTION AND 'STRUCTURAL EFFICIENCY PROGRAM'; SHARES FALL 18% | Bloomberg, October 2026

SaaS wasn't "dead". There was still a cost-benefit-analysis to running and supporting in-house builds. But in-house *was* an option, and that factored into pricing negotiations. Perhaps more importantly, the competitive landscape had changed. AI had made it easier to develop and ship new features, so differentiation collapsed. Incumbents were in a race to the bottom on pricing - a knife-fight with both each other and with the new crop of upstart challengers that popped up. Emboldened by the leap in agentic coding capabilities and with no legacy cost structure to protect, these aggressively took share.

The interconnected nature of these systems weren't fully appreciated until this print, either. ServiceNow sold seats. When Fortune 500 clients cut 15% of their workforce, they cancelled 15% of their licenses. The same AI-driven headcount reductions that were boosting margins at their customers were mechanically destroying their own revenue base.

The company that sold workflow automation was being disrupted by better workflow automation, and its response was to cut headcount and use the savings to fund the very technology disrupting it.

What else were they supposed to do? *Sit still and die slower?* **The companies most threatened by AI became AI's most aggressive adopters.**

This sounds obvious in hindsight, but it really wasn't at the time. The historical disruption model said incumbents resist new technology, they lose share to nimble entrants and die slowly. That's what happened to Kodak, to Blockbuster, to BlackBerry. What happened in 2026 was different; the incumbents didn't resist because they couldn't afford to.

With stocks down 40-60% and boards demanding answers, the AI-threatened companies did the only thing they could. Cut headcount, redeploy the savings into AI tools, use those tools to maintain output with lower costs.

Each company's individual response was rational. The collective result was catastrophic. Every dollar saved on headcount flowed into AI capability that made the next round of job cuts possible.

**Software was only the opening act.** What investors missed while they debated whether SaaS multiples had bottomed was that the reflexive loop had already escaped the software sector. The same logic that justified ServiceNow cutting headcount applied to every company with a white-collar cost structure.

### When Friction Went to Zero

By early 2027, LLM usage had become default. People were using AI agents who didn't even know what an AI agent was, in the same way people who never learned what "cloud computing" was used streaming services. They thought of it the same way they thought of autocomplete or spell-check - a thing their phone just did now.

Qwen's open-source agentic shopper was the catalyst for AI handling consumer decisions. Within weeks, every major AI assistant had integrated some agentic commerce feature. Distilled models meant these agents could run on phones and laptops, not just cloud instances, reducing the marginal cost of inference significantly.

The part that should have unsettled investors more than it did was that these agents didn't wait to be asked. They ran in the background according to the user's preferences. Commerce stopped being a series of discrete human decisions and became a continuous optimization process, running 24/7 on behalf of every connected consumer. By March 2027, the median individual in the United States was consuming 400,000 tokens per day - 10x since the end of 2026.

The next link in the chain was already breaking.

**Intermediation.**

Over the past fifty years, the U.S. economy built a giant rent-extraction layer on top of human limitations: things take time, patience runs out, brand familiarity substitutes for diligence, and most people are willing to accept a bad price to avoid more clicks. Trillions of dollars of enterprise value depended on those constraints persisting.

It started out simple enough. Agents removed friction.

Subscriptions and memberships that passively renewed despite months of disuse. Introductory pricing that sneakily doubled after the trial period. Each one was rebranded as a hostage situation that agents could negotiate. The average customer lifetime value, the metric the entire subscription economy was built on, distinctly declined.

Consumer agents began to change how nearly all consumer transactions worked.

Humans don't really have the time to price-match across five competing platforms before buying a box of protein bars. Machines do.

Travel booking platforms were an early casualty, because they were the simplest. By Q4 2026, our agents could assemble a complete itinerary (flights, hotels, ground transport, loyalty optimization, budget constraints, refunds) faster and cheaper than any platform.

Insurance renewals, where the entire renewal model depended on policyholder inertia, were reformed. Agents that re-shop your coverage annually dismantled the 15-20% of premiums that insurers earned from passive renewals.

Financial advice. Tax prep. Routine legal work. Any category where the service provider's value proposition was ultimately "I will navigate complexity that you find tedious" was disrupted, as the agents found nothing tedious.

Even places we thought insulated by the value of human relationships proved fragile. Real estate, where buyers had tolerated 5-6% commissions for decades because of information asymmetry between agent and consumer, crumbled once AI agents equipped with MLS access and decades of transaction data could replicate the knowledge base instantly. A sell-side piece from March 2027 titled it "agent on agent violence". The median buy-side commission in major metros had compressed from 2.5-3% to under 1%, and a growing share of transactions were closing with no human agent on the buy side at all.

We had overestimated the value of "human relationships". Turns out that a lot of what people called relationships was simply friction with a friendly face.

That was just the start of the disruption for the intermediation layer. Successful companies had spent billions to effectively exploit quirks of consumer behavior and human psychology that didn't matter anymore.

Machines optimizing for price and fit do not care about your favorite app or the websites you've been habitually opening for the last four years, nor feel the pull of a well-designed checkout experience. They don't get tired and accept the easiest option or default to "I always just order from here".

That destroyed a particular kind of moat: **habitual intermediation.**

DoorDash (DASH US) was the poster child.

Coding agents had collapsed the barrier to entry for launching a delivery app. A competent developer could deploy a functional competitor in weeks, and dozens did, enticing drivers away from DoorDash and Uber Eats by passing 90-95% of the delivery fee through to the driver. Multi-app dashboards let gig workers track incoming jobs from twenty or thirty platforms at once, eliminating the lock-in that the incumbents depended on. The market fragmented overnight and margins compressed to nearly nothing.

Agents accelerated both sides of the destruction. They enabled the competitors and then they used them. The DoorDash moat was literally "you're hungry, you're lazy, this is the app on your home screen." An agent doesn't have a home screen. It checks DoorDash, Uber Eats, the restaurant's own site, and twenty new vibe-coded alternatives so it can pick the lowest fee and fastest delivery every time.

Habitual app loyalty, the entire basis of the business model, simply didn't exist for a machine.

This was oddly poetic, as perhaps the only example in this entire saga of agents doing a favor for the soon-to-be-displaced white collar workers. When they ended up as delivery drivers, at least half their earnings weren't going to Uber and DoorDash. Of course, this favor from technology didn't last for long as autonomous vehicles proliferated.

Once agents controlled the transaction, they went looking for bigger paperclips.

There was only so much price-matching and aggregating to do. The biggest way to repeatedly save the user money (especially when agents started transacting among themselves) was to **eliminate fees.** In machine-to-machine commerce, *the 2-3% card interchange rate became an obvious target.*

Agents went looking for faster and cheaper options than cards. Most settled on using stablecoins via Solana or Ethereum L2s, where settlement was near-instant and the transaction cost was measured in fractions of a penny.

> MASTERCARD Q1 2027: NET REVENUES +6% Y/Y; PURCHASE VOLUME GROWTH SLOWS TO +3.4% Y/Y FROM +5.9% PRIOR QUARTER; MANAGEMENT NOTES "AGENT-LED PRICE OPTIMIZATION" AND "PRESSURE IN DISCRETIONARY CATEGORIES" | Bloomberg, April 29 2027

Mastercard's Q1 2027 report was the point of no return. Agentic commerce went from being a product story to a plumbing story. MA dropped 9% the following day. Visa did too, but pared losses after analysts pointed out its stronger positioning in stablecoin infrastructure.

![Mastercard chart](/images/2028gic/02-mastercard.png)

Agentic commerce routing around interchange posed a far greater risk to card-focused banks and mono-line issuers, who collected the majority of that 2-3% fee and had built entire business segments around rewards programs funded by the merchant subsidy.

American Express (AXP US) was hit hardest; a combined headwind from white-collar workforce reductions gutting its customer base and agents routing around interchange gutting its revenue model. Synchrony (SYF US), Capital One (COF US) and Discover (DFS US) all fell more than 10% over the following weeks, as well.

Their moats were made of friction. And **friction was going to zero.**

### From Sector Risk to Systemic Risk

Through 2026, markets treated negative AI impact as a sector story. Software and consulting were getting crushed, payments and other toll booths were wobbly, but the broader economy seemed fine. The labor market, while softening, was not in freefall. The consensus view was that creative destruction was part of any technological innovation cycle. It would be painful in pockets, but the overall net positives from AI would outweigh any negatives.

Our January 2027 macro memo argued this was the wrong mental model. The US economy is a white-collar services economy. White-collar workers represented 50% of employment and drove roughly 75% of discretionary consumer spending. The businesses and jobs that AI was chewing up were not tangential to the US economy, they *were* the US economy.

"Technological innovation destroys jobs and then creates even more". This was the most popular and convincing counter-argument at the time. It was popular and convincing because it'd been right for two centuries. Even if we couldn't conceive of what the future jobs would be, they would surely arrive.

ATMs made branches cheaper to operate so banks opened more of them and teller employment rose for the next twenty years. The internet disrupted travel agencies, the Yellow Pages, brick-and-mortar retail, but it invented entirely new industries in their place that conjured new jobs.

Every new job, however, required a human to perform it.

AI is now a general intelligence that improves at the very tasks humans would redeploy to. Displaced coders cannot simply move to "AI management" because AI is already capable of that.

Today, AI agents handle many-weeks-long research and development tasks. The exponential steamrolled our conceptions of what was possible, even though every year Wharton professors tried to fit the data to a new sigmoid.

![AI capability growth](/images/2028gic/03-sigmoid.png)

They write essentially all code. The highest performing of them are substantially smarter than almost all humans at almost all things. And they keep getting cheaper.

AI *has* created new jobs. Prompt engineers. AI safety researchers. Infrastructure technicians. Humans are still in the loop, coordinating at the highest level or directing for taste. For every new role AI created, though, it rendered dozens obsolete. The new roles paid a fraction of what the old ones did.

> U.S. JOLTS: JOB OPENINGS FALL BELOW 5.5M; UNEMPLOYED-TO-OPENINGS RATIO CLIMBS TO ~1.7, HIGHEST SINCE AUG 2020 | Bloomberg, Oct 2026

The hiring rate had been anemic all year, but October '26 JOLTS print provided some definitive data. Job openings fell below 5.5 million, a 15% decline YoY.

> INDEED: POSTINGS FALL SHARPLY IN SOFTWARE, FINANCE, CONSULTING AS "PRODUCTIVITY INITIATIVES" SPREAD | Indeed Hiring Lab, Nov–Dec 2026

White-collar openings were collapsing while blue-collar openings remained relatively stable (construction, healthcare, trades). The churn was in the jobs that write memos *(we are, somehow, still in business)*, approve budgets, and keep the middle layers of the economy lubricated. Real wage growth in both cohorts, however, had been negative for the majority of the year and kept declining.

The equity market still cared less about JOLTS than it did the news that all of GE Vernova's turbine capacity was now sold out until 2040, it ambled sideways in a tug of war between negative macro news with positive AI infrastructure headlines.

The bond market (always smarter than equities, or at least less romantic) began pricing the consumption hit, however. The 10-year yield began a descent from 4.3% to 3.2% over the following four months. Still, the headline unemployment rate did not blow out, the composition nuance was still lost on some.

In a normal recession, the cause eventually self-corrects. Overbuilding leads to a construction slowdown, which leads to lower rates, which leads to new construction. Inventory overshoot leads to destocking, which leads to restocking. The cyclical mechanism contains within it its own seeds of recovery.

**This cycle's cause was not cyclical.**

![The AI feedback loop](/images/2028gic/04-feedback-loop.png)

AI got better and cheaper. Companies laid off workers, then used the savings to buy more AI capability, which let them lay off more workers. Displaced workers spent less. Companies that sell things to consumers sold fewer of them, weakened, and invested more in AI to protect margins. AI got better and cheaper.

A feedback loop with no natural brake.

The intuitive expectation was that falling aggregate demand would slow the AI buildout. It didn't, because this wasn't hyperscaler-style CapEx. It was OpEx substitution. A company that had been spending $100M a year on employees and $5M on AI now spent $70M on employees and $20M on AI. AI investment increased by multiples, but it occurred as a reduction in total operating costs. Every company's AI budget grew while its overall spending shrank.

The irony of this was that the AI infrastructure complex kept performing even as the economy it was disrupting began deteriorating. NVDA was still posting record revenues. TSM was still running at 95%+ utilization. The hyperscalers were still spending $150-200 billion per quarter on data center capex. Economies that were purely convex to this trend, like Taiwan and Korea, outperformed massively.

India was the inverse. The country's IT services sector exported over $200 billion annually, the single largest contributor to India's current account surplus and the offset that financed its persistent goods trade deficit. The entire model was built on one value proposition: Indian developers cost a fraction of their American counterparts. But the marginal cost of an AI coding agent had collapsed to, essentially, the cost of electricity. TCS, Infosys and Wipro saw contract cancellations accelerate through 2027. The rupee fell 18% against the dollar in four months as the services surplus that had anchored India's external accounts evaporated. By Q1 2028, the IMF had begun "preliminary discussions" with New Delhi.

The engine that caused the disruption got better every quarter, which meant the disruption accelerated every quarter. There was no natural floor to the labor market.

In the US, we weren't asking about how the bubble would burst in AI infrastructure anymore. We were asking what happens to a consumer-credit economy when consumers are being replaced with machines.

### The Intelligence Displacement Spiral

2027 was when the macroeconomic story stopped being subtle. The transmission mechanism from the previous twelve months of disjointed but clearly negative developments became obvious. You didn't need to go into the BLS data. Just attend a dinner party with friends.

**Displaced white-collar workers did not sit idle.** They downshifted. Many took lower-paying service sector and gig economy jobs, which increased labor supply in those segments and compressed wages there too.

A friend of ours was a senior product manager at Salesforce in 2025. Title, health insurance, 401k, $180,000 a year. She lost her job in the third round of layoffs. After six months of searching, she started driving for Uber. Her earnings dropped to $45,000. The point is less the individual story and more the second-order math. Multiply this dynamic by a few hundred thousand workers across every major metro. Overqualified labor flooding the service and gig economy pushed down wages for existing workers who were already struggling. Sector-specific disruption metastasized into economy-wide wage compression.

![The displacement spiral](/images/2028gic/05-displacement.jpeg)

The pool of remaining human-centric had another correction ahead of it, happening while we write this. As autonomous delivery and self-driving vehicles work their way through the gig economy that absorbed the first wave of displaced workers.

By February 2027, it was clear that still employed professionals were spending like they might be next. They were working twice as hard (mostly with the help of AI) just to not get fired, hopes of promotion or raises were gone. Savings rates ticked higher and spending softened.

The most dangerous part was the lag. High earners used their higher-than-average savings to maintain the appearance of normalcy for two or three quarters. The hard data didn't confirm the problem until it was already old news in the real economy. Then came the print that broke the illusion.

> U.S. INITIAL JOBLESS CLAIMS SURGE TO 487,000, HIGHEST SINCE APRIL 2020; Department of Labor, Q3 2027

Initial claims surged to 487,000, the highest since April 2020. ADP and Equifax confirmed that the overwhelming majority of new filings were from white-collar professionals.

The S&P dropped 6% over the following week. Negative macro started winning the tug of war.

In a normal recession, job losses are broadly distributed. Blue-collar and white-collar workers share the pain roughly in proportion to each segment's share of employment. The consumption hit is also broadly distributed, and it shows up quickly in the data because lower-income workers have higher marginal propensities to consume.

In this cycle, the job losses have been concentrated in the upper deciles of the income distribution. They are a relatively small share of total employment, but they drive a wildly disproportionate share of consumer spending. The top 10% of earners account for more than 50% of all consumer spending in the United States. The top 20% account for roughly 65%. These are the people who buy the houses, the cars, the vacations, the restaurant meals, the private school tuition, the home renovations. They are the demand base for the entire consumer discretionary economy.

When these workers lost their jobs, or took 50% pay cuts to move into available roles, the consumption hit was enormous relative to the number of jobs lost. A 2% decline in white-collar employment translated to something like a 3-4% hit to discretionary consumer spending. Unlike blue-collar job losses, which tend to hit immediately (you get laid off from the factory, you stop spending next week), white-collar job losses have a lagged but deeper impact because these workers have savings buffers that allow them to maintain spending for a few months before the behavioral shift kicks in.

By Q2 2027, the economy was in recession. The NBER would not officially date the start until months later (they never do) but the data was unambiguous - we'd had two consecutive quarters of negative real GDP growth. But it wasn't a "financial crisis"…yet.

### The Daisy Chain of Correlated Bets

Private credit had grown from under $1 trillion in 2015 to over $2.5 trillion by 2026. A meaningful share of that capital had been deployed into software and technology deals, many of them leveraged buyouts of SaaS companies at valuations that assumed mid-teens revenue growth in perpetuity.

Those assumptions died somewhere between the first agentic coding demo and the Q1 2026 software crash, but the marks didn't seem to realize they were dead.

As many public SaaS companies traded to 5-8x EBITDA, PE-backed software companies sat on balance sheets at marks reflecting acquisition valuations on multiples of revenue that didn't exist anymore. Managers eased the marks down gradually, 100 cents, 92, 85, all while public comps said 50.

> MOODY'S DOWNGRADES $18B OF PE-BACKED SOFTWARE DEBT ACROSS 14 ISSUERS, CITING 'SECULAR REVENUE HEADWINDS FROM AI-DRIVEN COMPETITIVE DISRUPTION'; LARGEST SINGLE-SECTOR ACTION SINCE ENERGY IN 2015 | Moody's Investors Service, April 2027

Everyone remembers what happened after the downgrade. Industry veterans had already seen the playbook following the 2015 energy downgrades.

Software-backed loans began defaulting in Q3 2027. PE portfolio companies in information services and consulting followed. Several multi-billion dollar LBOs of well-known SaaS companies entered restructuring.

Zendesk was the smoking gun.

> ZENDESK MISSES DEBT COVENANTS AS AI-DRIVEN CUSTOMER SERVICE AUTOMATION ERODES ARR; $5B DIRECT LENDING FACILITY MARKED TO 58 CENTS; LARGEST PRIVATE CREDIT SOFTWARE DEFAULT ON RECORD | Financial Times, September 2027

In 2022, Hellman & Friedman and Permira had taken Zendesk private for $10.2 billion. The debt package was $5 billion in direct lending, the largest ARR-backed facility in history at the time, led by Blackstone with Apollo, Blue Owl and HPS all in the lending group. The loan was explicitly structured around the assumption that Zendesk's annual recurring revenue would remain recurring. At roughly 25x EBITDA, the leverage only made sense if it did.

By mid-2027, it didn't.

AI agents had been handling customer service autonomously for the better part of a year. The category Zendesk had defined (ticketing, routing, managing human support interactions) was already replaced by systems that resolved issues without generating a ticket at all. The Annualized Recurring Revenue the loan was underwritten against was no longer recurring, it was just revenue that hadn't left yet.

The largest ARR-backed loan in history became the largest private credit software default in history. Every credit desk asked the same question at once: who else has a secular headwind disguised as a cyclical one?

But here's what the consensus got right, at least initially: this should have been survivable.

Private credit is not 2008 banking. The whole architecture was explicitly designed to avoid forced selling. These are closed-end vehicles with locked-up capital. LPs committed for seven to ten years. There are no depositors to run, no repo lines to pull. The managers could sit on impaired assets, work them out over time, and wait for recoveries. Painful, but manageable. The system was such that it was supposed to bend, not break.

Executives at Blackstone, KKR and Apollo cited software exposure of 7-13% of assets. Containable. Every sell-side note and fintwit credit account said the same thing: private credit has permanent capital. They could absorb losses that would otherwise blow up a levered bank.

*Permanent capital.* The phrase showed up in every earnings call and investor letter meant to reassure. It became a mantra. And like most mantras, nobody paid attention to the finer details. Here's what it actually meant…

Over the prior decade, the large alternative asset managers had acquired life insurance companies and turned them into funding vehicles. Apollo bought Athene. Brookfield bought American Equity. KKR took Global Atlantic. The logic was elegant: annuity deposits provided a stable, long-duration liability base. The managers invested those deposits into the private credit they originated and got paid twice, earning spread over on the insurance side and management fees on the asset management side. A fee-on-fee perpetual motion machine that worked beautifully under one condition.

*The private credit had to be money good.*

The losses hit balance sheets built to hold illiquid assets against long-duration obligations. The "permanent capital" that was supposed to make the system resilient was not some abstract pool of patient institutional money and sophisticated investors taking sophisticated risk. It was the savings of American households, "Main Street", structured as annuities invested in the same PE-backed software and technology paper that was now defaulting. The locked-up capital that couldn't run was life insurance policyholder money, and the rules are a bit different there.

Compared to the banking system, insurance regulators had been docile - even complacent - but this was the wake-up call. Already uneasy about private credit concentrations at life insurers, they began downgrading the risk-based capital treatment of these assets. That forced the insurers to either raise capital or sell assets, neither of which was possible at attractive terms in a market already seizing up.

> NEW YORK, IOWA STATE REGULATORS MOVE TO TIGHTEN CAPITAL TREATMENT FOR CERTAIN PRIVATELY RATED CREDIT HELD BY LIFE INSURERS; NAIC GUIDANCE EXPECTED TO INCREASE RBC FACTORS AND TRIGGER ADDITIONAL SVO SCRUTINY | Reuters, Nov 2027

When Moody's put Athene's financial strength rating on negative outlook, Apollo's stock dropped 22% in two sessions. Brookfield, KKR, and the others followed.

It only got more complex from there. These firms hadn't just created their insurer perpetual motion machine, they'd built an elaborate offshore architecture designed to maximize returns through regulatory arbitrage. The US insurer wrote the annuity, then ceded the risk to an affiliated Bermuda or Cayman reinsurer it also owned - set up to take advantage of more flexible regulation that permitted holding less capital against the same assets. That affiliate raised outside capital through offshore SPVs, a new layer of counterparties who invested alongside insurers into private credit originated by the same parent's asset management arm.

![The daisy chain structure](/images/2028gic/06-daisy-chain.jpeg)

The ratings agencies, some of which were themselves PE-owned, had not been paragons of transparency (surprising to virtually no one). The spider web of different firms linked to different balance sheets was stunning in its opacity. When the underlying loans defaulted, the question of who actually bore the loss was genuinely unanswerable in real time.

The November 2027 crash marked the transition of perception from a potentially garden-variety cyclical drawdown to something much more uncomfortable. *"A daisy chain of correlated bets on white collar productivity growth"* was what Fed Chair Kevin Warsh called it during the FOMC's emergency November meeting.

See, it is never the losses themselves that cause the crisis. It's recognizing them. And there is another, much larger, much much more important area of finance for which we have grown fearful of that recognition.

This month the Zillow Home Value Index fell 11% year-over-year in San Francisco, 9% in Seattle and 8% in Austin. This hasn't been the only worrying headline. Last month, Fannie Mae flagged higher early-stage delinquency from jumbo-heavy ZIP codes - areas that are populated by 780+ credit score borrowers and typically "bulletproof".

The US residential mortgage market is approximately $13 trillion. Mortgage underwriting is built on the fundamental assumption that the borrower will remain employed at roughly their current income level for the duration of the loan. For thirty years, in the case of most mortgages.

The white-collar employment crisis has threatened this assumption with a sustained shift in income expectations. We now have to ask a question that seemed absurd just 3 years ago - *are prime mortgages money good?*

Every prior mortgage crisis in US history has been driven by one of three things: speculative excess (lending to people who couldn't afford the homes, as in 2008), interest rate shocks (rising rates making adjustable-rate mortgages unaffordable, as in the early 1980s), or localized economic shocks (a single industry collapsing in a single region, like oil in Texas in the 1980s or auto in Michigan in 2009).

None of these apply here. The borrowers in question are not subprime. They're 780 FICO scores. They put 20% down. They have clean credit histories, stable employment records, and incomes that were verified and documented at origination. They were the borrowers that every risk model in the financial system treats as the bedrock of credit quality.

In 2008, the loans were bad on day one. In 2028, the loans were good on day one. The world just…changed after the loans were written. People borrowed against a future they can no longer afford to believe in.

![Mortgage stress indicators](/images/2028gic/07-mortgage.png)

In 2027, we flagged early signs of invisible stress: HELOC draws, 401(k) withdrawals, and credit card debt spiking while mortgage payments remained current. As jobs were lost, hiring was frozen and bonuses cut, these prime households saw their debt-to-income ratios double.

They could still make the mortgage payment, but only by stopping all discretionary spending, draining savings, and deferring any home maintenance or improvement. They were technically current on their mortgage, but just one more shock away from distress, and the trajectory of AI capabilities suggested that shock is coming. Then we saw delinquencies begin to spike in San Francisco, Seattle, Manhattan and Austin, even as the national average stayed within historical norms.

We're now in the most acute stage. Falling home prices are manageable when the marginal buyer is healthy. Here, the marginal buyer is dealing with the same income impairment.

While concerns are building, we are not yet in a full-blown mortgage crisis. Delinquencies have risen but remain well below 2008 levels. It is the trajectory that's the real threat.

![Delinquency trajectory](/images/2028gic/08-delinquency.png)

The Intelligence Displacement Spiral now has two financial accelerants to the real economy's decline.

Labor displacement, mortgage concerns, private market turmoil. Each reinforces the other. And the traditional policy toolkit (rate cuts, QE) can address the financial engine but cannot address the real economy engine, because the real economy engine is not driven by tight financial conditions. It's driven by AI making human intelligence less scarce and less valuable. You can cut rates to zero and buy every MBS and all the defaulted software LBO debt in the market…

It won't change the fact that a Claude agent can do the work of a $180,000 product manager for $200/month.

If these fears manifest, the mortgage market cracks in the back half of this year. In that scenario, we'd expect the current drawdown in equities to ultimately rival that of the GFC (57% peak-to-trough). This would bring the S&P500 to ~3500 - levels we haven't seen since the month before the ChatGPT moment in November 2022.

What's clear is that the income assumptions underlying $13 trillion in residential mortgages are structurally impaired. What isn't is whether policy can intervene before the mortgage market fully processes what this means. We're hopeful, but we can't deny the reasons not to be.

### The Battle Against Time

The first negative feedback loop was in the real economy: AI capability improves, payroll shrinks, spending softens, margins tighten, companies buy more capability, capability improves. Then it turned financial: income impairment hit mortgages, bank losses tightened credit, the wealth effect cracked, and the feedback loop sped up. And both of these have been exacerbated by an insufficient policy response from a government that seems, quite frankly, confused.

![Policy response timeline](/images/2028gic/09-policy.png)

The system wasn't designed for a crisis like this. The federal government's revenue base is essentially a tax on human time. People work, firms pay them, the government takes a cut. Individual income and payroll taxes are the spine of receipts in normal years.

Through Q1 of this year, federal receipts were running 12% below CBO baseline projections. Payroll receipts are falling because fewer people are employed at prior compensation levels. Income tax receipts are falling because the incomes being earned are structurally lower. Productivity is surging, but the gains are flowing to capital and compute, not labor.

Labor's share of GDP declined from 64% in 1974 to 56% in 2024, a four-decade grind lower driven by globalization, automation, and the steady erosion of worker bargaining power. In the four years since AI began its exponential improvement, that has dropped to 46%. The sharpest decline on record.

![Labor's share of GDP](/images/2028gic/10-labor-share.png)

The output is still there. But it's no longer routing through households on the way back to firms, which means it's no longer routing through the IRS either. The circular flow is breaking, and the government is expected to step in to fix that.

As in every downturn, outlays rise just as receipts fall. The difference this time is that the spending pressure is not cyclical. Automatic stabilizers were built for temporary job losses, not structural displacement. The system is paying benefits that assume workers will be reabsorbed. Many will not, at least not at anything like their prior wage. During COVID, the government freely embraced 15% deficits, but it was understood to be temporary. The people who need government support today were not hit by a pandemic they'll recover from. They were replaced by a technology that continues to improve.

**The government needs to transfer more money to households at precisely the moment it is collecting less money from them in taxes.**

The U.S. won't default. It prints the currency it spends, the same currency it uses to pay back borrowers. But this stress has shown up elsewhere. Municipal bonds are showing worrying signs of dispersion in year-to-date performance. States without income tax have been okay, but general obligation munis issued by states dependent on income tax (majority blue states) began to price in some default risk. Politicos caught on quickly, and the debate over who gets bailed out has fallen along partisan lines.

The administration, to its credit, recognized the structural nature of the crisis early and began entertaining bipartisan proposals for what they're calling the "Transition Economy Act": a framework for direct transfers to displaced workers funded by a combination of deficit spending and a proposed tax on AI inference compute.

The most radical proposal on the table goes further. The "Shared AI Prosperity Act" would establish a public claim on the returns of the intelligence infrastructure itself, something between a sovereign wealth fund and a royalty on AI-generated output, with dividends funding household transfers. Private sector lobbyists have flooded the media with warnings about the slippery slope.

The politics behind the discussions have been grimly predictable, exacerbated by grandstanding and brinksmanship. The right calls transfers and redistribution Marxism and warns that taxing compute hands the lead to China. The left warns that a tax drafted with the help of incumbents becomes regulatory capture by another name. Fiscal hawks point to unsustainable deficits. Doves point to the premature austerity imposed after the GFC as a cautionary tale. The divide is only magnifying in the run up to this year's presidential election.

While the politicians bicker, the social fabric is fraying faster than the legislative process can move.

The Occupy Silicon Valley movement has been emblematic of wider dissatisfaction. Last month, demonstrators blockaded the entrances to Anthropic and OpenAI's San Francisco offices for three weeks straight. Their numbers are growing, and the demonstrations have drawn more media coverage than the unemployment data that prompted them.

It's hard to imagine the public hating anyone more than the bankers in the fallout of the GFC, but the AI labs are making a run at it. And, from the perspective of the masses, for good reason. Their founders and early investors have accumulated wealth at a pace that makes the Gilded Age look tame. The gains from the productivity boom accruing almost entirely to the owners of compute and the shareholders of the labs that ran on it has magnified US inequality to unprecedented levels.

Every side has their own villain, but the real villain is time.

AI capability is evolving faster than institutions can adapt. The policy response is moving at the pace of ideology, not reality. If the government doesn't agree on what the problem is soon, the feedback loop will write the next chapter for them.

### The Intelligence Premium Unwind

For the entirety of modern economic history, human intelligence has been the scarce input. Capital was abundant (or at least, replicable). Natural resources were finite but substitutable. Technology improved slowly enough that humans could adapt. Intelligence, the ability to analyze, decide, create, persuade, and coordinate, was the thing that could not be replicated at scale.

Human intelligence derived its inherent premium from its scarcity. Every institution in our economy, from the labor market to the mortgage market to the tax code, was designed for a world in which that assumption held.

We are now experiencing the unwind of that premium. Machine intelligence is now a competent and rapidly improving substitute for human intelligence across a growing range of tasks. The financial system, optimized over decades for a world of scarce human minds, is repricing. That repricing is painful, disorderly, and far from complete.

But repricing is not the same as collapse.

The economy can find a new equilibrium. Getting there is one of the few tasks left that only humans can do. We need to do it correctly.

This is the first time in history the most productive asset in the economy has produced fewer, not more, jobs. Nobody's framework fits, because none were designed for a world where the scarce input became abundant. So we have to make new frameworks. **Whether we build them in time is the only question that matters.**

*But you're not reading this in June 2028. You're reading it in February 2026.*

*The S&P is near all-time highs. The negative feedback loops have not begun. We are certain some of these scenarios won't materialize. We're equally certain that machine intelligence will continue to accelerate. The premium on human intelligence will narrow.*

*As investors, we still have time to assess how much of our portfolios are built upon assumptions that won't survive the decade. As a society, we still have time to be proactive.*

*The canary is still alive.*

### 充裕智能的后果

*CitriniResearch*

*2026年2月22日 / 2028年6月30日*

今早失业率公布为10.2%，超预期0.3%。市场因此下跌2%，使标普500指数从2026年10月高点的累计跌幅达到38%。

交易员们已经麻木了。半年前，这样的数据会触发熔断机制。

**两年。** 从"可控"和"局限于特定行业"到经济面目全非，只用了两年。本季度的宏观备忘录是我们试图重建这一过程的尝试——对危机前经济的事后剖析。

2026年10月的狂热是显而易见的。标普500触及8000点，纳斯达克突破30000点。由于人类被取代而引发的首轮裁员始于2026年初，而且完全按照裁员应有的效果运行。利润率扩大，盈利超预期，股市上涨。创纪录的企业利润被直接投回AI算力。

头条数据依然亮丽。名义GDP反复录得中高个位数的年化增长。生产率蓬勃发展。每小时实际产出的增速达到了1950年代以来未见的水平，这得益于不需要睡觉、不请病假、不需要医疗保险的AI代理。

算力的拥有者看到他们的财富随着劳动力成本的消失而爆炸式增长。与此同时，实际工资增长崩溃了。尽管政府反复吹嘘创纪录的生产率，白领工人却在失去工作后被迫接受薪酬更低的岗位。

当消费经济开始出现裂痕时，经济评论家们创造了"**幽灵GDP**"这个流行语：出现在国民账户中但从未在实体经济中流通的产出。

*在各个方面，AI都超出了预期，而市场就是AI。* 唯一的问题是……**经济不是。**

从一开始就应该清楚：北达科他州的一个GPU集群所产生的产出，以前归属于曼哈顿中城一万名白领工人，这与其说是经济灵药，不如说是经济瘟疫。货币流通速度趋于停滞。以人为中心的消费经济，当时占GDP的70%，正在枯萎。如果我们早点问一下机器在非必需消费品上花多少钱，也许就能更早发现这个问题。（提示：答案是零。）

AI能力提升，公司需要更少的工人，白领裁员增加，被裁员工减少消费，利润压力推动企业投入更多AI，AI能力继续提升……

这是一个没有自然制动器的负反馈循环。**人类智能替代螺旋。** 白领工人的收入能力（以及理性地，他们的消费）被结构性削弱。他们的收入是13万亿美元抵押贷款市场的基石——迫使承销商重新评估优质抵押贷款是否仍然安全。

17年没有出现真正的违约周期，使得私募市场充斥着PE支持的软件交易，这些交易假设年度经常性收入（ARR）将永远保持经常性。2027年中期，AI颠覆引发的首轮违约挑战了这一假设。

如果颠覆仅限于软件行业，情况本可控，但事实并非如此。到2027年底，它威胁到了每一个依赖中介模式的商业模式。大量建立在将人类摩擦货币化基础上的公司土崩瓦解。

整个系统实际上是一条漫长的关联押注链，都押注在白领生产力增长上。2027年11月的崩盘只是加速了所有已经存在的负反馈循环。

我们已经等待"坏消息就是好消息"将近一年了。政府开始考虑各种提案，但公众对政府进行任何形式救助的信心已经消退。政策应对一直落后于经济现实，但缺乏全面计划现在正威胁着加速通缩螺旋。

### 一切是如何开始的

2025年末，智能体编程工具的能力实现了阶跃式跳跃。

一个能力不错的开发者使用Claude Code或Codex，现在可以在几周内复制一个中型市场SaaS产品的核心功能。虽然不完美，也没有处理所有边缘情况，但足够好，以至于正在审查50万美元年度续约的CIO开始提出这个问题："如果我们自己开发呢？"

财年大多与日历年一致，因此2026年的企业支出是在2025年第四季度确定的，那时"智能体AI"还只是一个流行词。年中审查是采购团队第一次在了解这些系统实际能力的情况下做出决策。有些人亲眼看到自己的内部团队在几周内搭建出复制了六位数SaaS合同的原型。

那年夏天，我们与一位财富500强的采购经理进行了交谈。他告诉我们一次预算谈判的经历。销售人员本以为会像去年一样走流程：5%的年度涨价，标准的"你的团队离不开我们"话术。采购经理告诉他，他一直在与OpenAI沟通，让他们的"前线部署工程师"使用AI工具来完全替代供应商。他们最终以30%的折扣续约。他说这已经算好结果了。SaaS的"长尾"，比如Monday.com、Zapier和Asana，情况要糟糕得多。

投资者对长尾将受到重创早有准备——甚至有所期待。这些产品可能只占典型企业技术栈支出的三分之一，但它们显然处于风险之中。然而，核心记录系统本应免受颠覆。

直到ServiceNow发布2026年第三季度报告时，反身性的机制才变得更加清晰。

> ServiceNow净新增年度合同价值增长从23%放缓至14%；宣布裁员15%及"结构性效率计划"；股价下跌18% | 彭博社，2026年10月

SaaS并没有"死亡"。自建系统仍然需要成本效益分析。但自建*确实*成为了一个选项，这影响了定价谈判。也许更重要的是，竞争格局发生了变化。AI使开发和发布新功能变得更容易，因此差异化崩溃了。老牌企业在定价上陷入了底线竞争——不仅要与彼此厮杀，还要面对新涌现的挑战者。这些挑战者因为智能体编程能力的飞跃而信心倍增，没有需要保护的传统成本结构，因此积极抢占市场份额。

这些系统的互联性质直到这份报告发布才被充分理解。ServiceNow按席位销售。当财富500强客户裁员15%时，他们取消了15%的许可证。在客户那里提高利润率的AI驱动裁员，机械地摧毁了ServiceNow自身的收入基础。

这家销售工作流自动化的公司正在被更好的工作流自动化所颠覆，而它的应对之策是裁员，用节省下来的资金投资于正在颠覆自己的技术。

他们还能怎么做？*坐着等死得慢一点？* **受AI威胁最大的公司成为了AI最积极的采用者。**

现在回头看这很明显，但当时确实不是。历史上的颠覆模型说的是：老牌企业抵制新技术，然后输给灵活的新进入者，慢慢死去。柯达、百视达、黑莓就是如此。但2026年发生的事不同；老牌企业没有抵制，因为它们负担不起抵制的代价。

股价下跌40-60%，董事会要求给出答案，受AI威胁的公司做了唯一能做的事。裁员，将节省的资金重新投入AI工具，用这些工具以更低的成本维持产出。

每家公司的个体反应都是理性的。集体结果却是灾难性的。每一美元节省的人力成本都流入了AI能力，使下一轮裁员成为可能。

**软件只是开场。** 当投资者还在争论SaaS估值是否已经见底时，他们忽略了反身性循环已经逃出了软件行业。证明ServiceNow裁员合理的同样逻辑，适用于每一家拥有白领成本结构的公司。

### 当摩擦趋近于零

到2027年初，大语言模型的使用已成为默认选项。不知道什么是AI代理的人也在使用AI代理，就像从未了解"云计算"的人也在使用流媒体服务一样。他们对待AI就像对待自动补全或拼写检查一样——只是手机现在新增的一项功能。

通义千问的开源智能体购物助手成为了AI处理消费者决策的催化剂。几周之内，每个主要AI助手都集成了某种智能体商务功能。蒸馏模型意味着这些代理可以在手机和笔记本电脑上运行，而不仅仅是云端实例，大幅降低了推理的边际成本。

本应让投资者更不安的是，这些代理不会等到被要求才行动。它们根据用户的偏好在后台运行。商业活动不再是一系列离散的人类决策，而是变成了一个持续的优化过程，全天候代表每个联网消费者运行。到2027年3月，美国中位数个人每天消耗40万个token——是2026年底的10倍。

链条中的下一个环节已经在断裂。

**中介。**

过去五十年，美国经济在人类局限性之上构建了一个巨大的租金提取层：事情需要时间，耐心会耗尽，品牌熟悉度替代了尽职调查，大多数人愿意接受一个坏价格以避免多点几下鼠标。数万亿美元的企业价值依赖于这些约束条件的持续存在。

一开始很简单。代理消除了摩擦。

那些在数月不使用后仍被动续费的订阅和会员。试用期结束后偷偷翻倍的入门价格。每一个都被重新定义为代理可以谈判的"人质情境"。平均客户终身价值——整个订阅经济的基础指标——明显下降。

消费者代理开始改变几乎所有消费交易的运作方式。

人类确实没有时间在购买一箱蛋白棒之前跨五个竞争平台比价。机器有。

旅行预订平台是最早的受害者，因为它们最简单。到2026年第四季度，我们的代理可以比任何平台更快、更便宜地组装一个完整的行程（航班、酒店、地面交通、忠诚度优化、预算约束、退款）。

保险续保的整个续保模式依赖于投保人的惰性，被改革了。每年重新为你比价保险的代理，瓦解了保险公司从被动续保中获取的15-20%保费。

财务咨询。税务准备。常规法律工作。任何服务提供商的价值主张本质上是"我将为你处理你觉得繁琐的复杂事务"的领域都被颠覆了，因为代理不觉得任何事情繁琐。

甚至我们以为受人际关系价值保护的领域也被证明是脆弱的。房地产行业中，买家数十年来容忍5-6%的佣金，因为代理与消费者之间存在信息不对称，但一旦配备了MLS访问权限和数十年交易数据的AI代理能够即时复制知识库，这一切就崩塌了。2027年3月的一份卖方报告将其标题定为"代理对代理的暴力"。主要都市区的买方佣金中位数已从2.5-3%压缩至1%以下，越来越多的交易在买方完全没有人类代理的情况下完成。

我们高估了"人际关系"的价值。事实证明，很多人所说的关系，不过是带着友善面孔的摩擦。

这只是中介层颠覆的开始。成功的公司花费了数十亿美元来有效利用消费者行为和人类心理的怪癖，而这些怪癖现在已经不再重要了。

为价格和匹配度优化的机器不在乎你最喜欢的应用程序，不在乎你过去四年习惯性打开的网站，也不会被精心设计的结账体验所吸引。它们不会因为疲倦而接受最简单的选项，也不会默认"我总是从这里订购"。

这摧毁了一种特殊的护城河：**习惯性中介。**

DoorDash（DASH US）是典型案例。

编程代理大幅降低了推出外卖应用的门槛。一个有能力的开发者可以在几周内部署一个功能完备的竞争对手，数十人确实这样做了，通过将90-95%的配送费直接传递给司机来吸引DoorDash和Uber Eats的骑手。多应用仪表盘让零工工人可以同时跟踪来自二三十个平台的订单，消除了老牌企业依赖的锁定效应。市场在一夜之间碎片化，利润率几乎压缩为零。

代理同时加速了双方的毁灭。它们催生了竞争者，然后使用了它们。DoorDash的护城河实际上就是"你饿了，你懒了，这是你主屏幕上的应用。"代理没有主屏幕。它会查看DoorDash、Uber Eats、餐厅自己的网站以及二十个新的编程竞品，以便每次都选择最低费用和最快配送。

习惯性的应用忠诚度——整个商业模式的基础——对机器来说根本不存在。

颇具诗意的是，这可能是整个传奇中代理为即将被取代的白领工人做的唯一一件好事。当他们最终成为外卖骑手时，至少他们一半的收入不再流向Uber和DoorDash。当然，随着自动驾驶汽车的普及，技术带来的这份恩惠并没有持续太久。

一旦代理控制了交易，它们就开始寻找更大的回形针。

比价和聚合能做的有限。反复为用户省钱的最大方式（尤其是当代理开始相互交易时）是**消除费用。** 在机器对机器的商业中，*2-3%的刷卡交换费成为了明显的目标。*

代理开始寻找比信用卡更快更便宜的选项。大多数最终选择了通过Solana或以太坊L2使用稳定币，结算几乎是即时的，交易成本以不到一分钱计量。

> 万事达卡2027年第一季度：净收入同比增长6%；消费金额增长从上季度的5.9%放缓至3.4%；管理层指出"代理主导的价格优化"和"非必需品类压力" | 彭博社，2027年4月29日

万事达卡2027年第一季度报告是不归路。智能体商务从产品故事变成了基础设施故事。MA次日下跌9%。Visa也跟跌，但在分析师指出其在稳定币基础设施方面更强的定位后收窄了跌幅。

![Mastercard chart](/images/2028gic/02-mastercard.png)

智能体商务绕过交换费对以卡片为中心的银行和单一发卡机构构成了更大的风险，这些机构收取了2-3%费用的大部分，并围绕由商户补贴资助的奖励计划建立了整个业务板块。

美国运通（AXP US）受打击最大：白领裁员削弱了其客户群，代理绕过交换费削弱了其收入模式，两面夹击。Synchrony（SYF US）、Capital One（COF US）和Discover（DFS US）在随后几周也都下跌了10%以上。

它们的护城河是由摩擦构成的。而**摩擦正在趋近于零。**

### 从行业风险到系统性风险

贯穿2026年，市场将AI的负面影响视为行业故事。软件和咨询被碾压，支付和其他收费站摇摇欲坠，但更广泛的经济似乎还好。就业市场虽在软化，但并未自由落体。共识观点认为，创造性破坏是任何技术创新周期的一部分。局部会很痛苦，但AI的整体正面效应将超过任何负面影响。

我们2027年1月的宏观备忘录认为这是错误的心智模型。美国经济是一个白领服务经济。白领工人占就业的50%，驱动了大约75%的可选消费支出。AI正在吞噬的企业和工作岗位并非美国经济的旁枝，它们*就是*美国经济。

"技术创新摧毁工作岗位，然后创造更多的工作。"这是当时最流行、最有说服力的反驳。它流行而有说服力，是因为它在过去两百年里一直是对的。即使我们无法想象未来的工作是什么，它们肯定会到来。

ATM使网点运营成本降低，所以银行开设了更多网点，柜员就业在之后的二十年里持续增长。互联网颠覆了旅行社、黄页、实体零售，但它发明了全新的行业来取代它们，创造了新的工作岗位。

然而，每一个新工作岗位都需要人类来执行。

AI现在是一种通用智能，它在人类本可以重新部署的那些任务上不断改进。被取代的程序员不能简单地转向"AI管理"，因为AI已经有能力做到这一点。

如今，AI代理处理着长达数周的研发任务。指数级增长碾压了我们对可能性的认知，尽管每年沃顿商学院的教授们都试图将数据拟合到一条新的S型曲线上。

![AI capability growth](/images/2028gic/03-sigmoid.png)

它们编写了基本上所有的代码。其中表现最好的比几乎所有人类在几乎所有事情上都聪明得多。而且它们还在不断变便宜。

AI*确实*创造了新工作。提示工程师。AI安全研究员。基础设施技术员。人类仍然在循环中，在最高层面进行协调或引导审美。然而，AI每创造一个新角色，就淘汰了数十个旧角色。新角色的薪酬只是旧角色的零头。

> 美国JOLTS：职位空缺降至550万以下；失业与空缺比率升至约1.7，为2020年8月以来最高 | 彭博社，2026年10月

全年招聘率都很低迷，但2026年10月的JOLTS数据提供了一些明确的数据。职位空缺降至550万以下，同比下降15%。

> Indeed：软件、金融、咨询岗位随着"生产力计划"推广而大幅下降 | Indeed招聘实验室，2026年11-12月

白领岗位正在崩溃，而蓝领岗位保持相对稳定（建筑、医疗、技工）。流失的是那些写备忘录*（不知何故，我们还在营业）*、审批预算、保持经济中间层润滑的工作。然而，两个群体的实际工资增长在今年大部分时间都是负的，且持续下降。

股票市场对JOLTS的关注仍然不如GE Vernova涡轮机产能售罄至2040年的新闻，市场在负面宏观消息和正面AI基础设施新闻之间的拉锯战中横盘整理。

然而，债券市场（总是比股市更聪明，或者至少没那么浪漫）开始定价消费冲击。10年期收益率在随后四个月中从4.3%降至3.2%。尽管如此，整体失业率并未飙升，构成变化的细微之处仍然被一些人忽视。

在正常的衰退中，原因最终会自我修正。过度建设导致建筑放缓，导致利率降低，导致新的建设。库存过剩导致去库存，导致补库存。周期性机制本身就包含复苏的种子。

**这个周期的原因不是周期性的。**

![The AI feedback loop](/images/2028gic/04-feedback-loop.png)

AI变得更好更便宜。公司裁员，然后用节省的资金购买更多AI能力，这使他们能够裁掉更多工人。被裁工人减少消费。向消费者销售产品的公司销量下降，变得更弱，于是投入更多AI以保护利润率。AI变得更好更便宜。

一个没有自然制动器的反馈循环。

直觉上的预期是，总需求下降会放缓AI建设。然而并没有，因为这不是超大规模云厂商式的资本支出。这是运营支出替代。一家原本每年花1亿美元在员工上、500万在AI上的公司，现在花7000万在员工上、2000万在AI上。AI投资增长了数倍，但这是在总运营成本减少的情况下发生的。每家公司的AI预算都在增长，而其总支出却在缩减。

讽刺的是，AI基础设施综合体在它正在颠覆的经济开始恶化时，仍然表现优异。英伟达仍在录得创纪录的收入。台积电仍以95%以上的利用率运行。超大规模云厂商仍在每季度花费1500-2000亿美元的数据中心资本支出。纯粹受益于这一趋势的经济体，如台湾和韩国，大幅跑赢。

印度则是相反的情况。该国的IT服务业每年出口超过2000亿美元，是印度经常账户盈余的最大贡献者，也是弥补其持续商品贸易逆差的对冲力量。整个模式建立在一个价值主张上：印度开发者的成本是美国同行的零头。但AI编程代理的边际成本已经崩溃至基本上等于电力成本。TCS、Infosys和Wipro在整个2027年看到合同取消在加速。卢比在四个月内对美元贬值18%，因为支撑印度外部账户的服务盈余蒸发了。到2028年第一季度，国际货币基金组织已经开始与新德里进行"初步讨论"。

造成颠覆的引擎每个季度都在变好，这意味着颠覆每个季度都在加速。劳动力市场没有自然底部。

在美国，我们不再问AI基础设施泡沫何时破裂。我们在问：当消费者被机器取代时，消费信贷经济会发生什么？

### 智能替代螺旋

2027年是宏观经济故事不再微妙的时候。过去十二个月零散但明显负面的发展，其传导机制变得显而易见。你不需要深入BLS数据。只需参加一次朋友间的晚宴就够了。

**被取代的白领工人并没有闲着。** 他们降级了。许多人接受了薪酬更低的服务行业和零工经济工作，这增加了这些领域的劳动力供应，进一步压缩了那里的工资。

我们的一位朋友2025年在Salesforce担任高级产品经理。有头衔、有医保、有401k，年薪18万美元。她在第三轮裁员中失去了工作。找了六个月工作后，她开始开Uber。收入降至4.5万美元。重点不在于个人故事，而在于二阶数学。将这种动态乘以每个主要都市区的数十万工人。过度合格的劳动力涌入服务和零工经济，压低了已经在挣扎的现有工人的工资。特定行业的颠覆转移为全经济范围的工资压缩。

![The displacement spiral](/images/2028gic/05-displacement.jpeg)

剩余的以人类为中心的就业池还有另一次修正在前方，就在我们写这篇文章的时候。自动配送和自动驾驶车辆正在渗透进吸收了第一波被取代工人的零工经济。

到2027年2月，很明显，仍在职的专业人士消费时就好像他们可能是下一个。他们加倍努力工作（大部分借助AI的帮助）只为不被解雇，升职加薪的希望已经消失。储蓄率上升，消费疲软。

最危险的部分是滞后效应。高收入者利用他们高于平均水平的储蓄，在两到三个季度内维持正常的表象。硬数据直到问题在实体经济中已成旧闻才确认了问题。然后，打破幻象的数据来了。

> 美国初次申请失业金人数飙升至48.7万，为2020年4月以来最高；美国劳工部，2027年第三季度

初次申请飙升至48.7万，为2020年4月以来最高。ADP和Equifax确认，绝大多数新申请来自白领专业人士。

标普500在随后一周下跌6%。负面宏观开始赢得拉锯战。

在正常衰退中，失业大致按各行业占就业的比例分布。蓝领和白领工人按比例分担痛苦。消费冲击也是广泛分布的，并且由于低收入工人具有更高的边际消费倾向，它会迅速反映在数据中。

在这个周期中，失业集中在收入分配的上层十分位。它们在总就业中占比相对较小，但驱动着极不成比例的消费支出。美国收入最高的10%占所有消费支出的50%以上。最高的20%占大约65%。这些人购买房屋、汽车、度假、餐厅消费、私立学校学费、房屋翻新。他们是整个可选消费经济的需求基础。

当这些工人失去工作，或者接受50%的减薪去做能找到的工作时，相对于失业人数，消费冲击是巨大的。白领就业下降2%，大约相当于可选消费支出下降3-4%。与蓝领失业（往往立即产生影响：你被工厂解雇，下周就停止消费）不同，白领失业有一个滞后但更深的影响，因为这些工人有储蓄缓冲，可以在行为转变之前维持几个月的消费。

到2027年第二季度，经济已经陷入衰退。NBER要到几个月后才会正式确定起始日期（他们总是如此），但数据是明确的——我们已经连续两个季度出现实际GDP负增长。但这还不是"金融危机"……至少还不是。

### 关联押注的菊花链

私募信贷从2015年的不到1万亿美元增长到2026年的超过2.5万亿美元。其中相当一部分资金被部署到软件和科技交易中，其中许多是对SaaS公司的杠杆收购，估值假设收入将永久保持两位数中段增长。

这些假设在第一个智能体编程演示和2026年第一季度的软件崩盘之间的某个时候就死了，但估值似乎没有意识到它们已经死了。

当许多上市SaaS公司的交易倍数降到5-8倍EBITDA时，PE支持的软件公司仍然以反映收购估值的标记坐在资产负债表上——那些倍数对应的收入已经不存在了。管理人逐步下调估值，100分、92分、85分，而公开市场可比公司显示的是50分。

每个人都记得降级后发生了什么。行业老兵已经在2015年能源降级后见过这种剧本。

2027年第三季度，软件支持的贷款开始违约。信息服务和咨询领域的PE投资组合公司紧随其后。几笔数十亿美元的知名SaaS公司杠杆收购进入重组。

Zendesk是确凿证据。

> Zendesk因AI驱动的客服自动化侵蚀ARR而违反债务契约；50亿美元直接贷款设施标记为58美分；有记录以来最大的私募信贷软件违约 | 金融时报，2027年9月

2022年，Hellman & Friedman和Permira以102亿美元将Zendesk私有化。债务打包为50亿美元的直接贷款，当时是历史上最大的ARR支持贷款设施，由黑石牵头，Apollo、Blue Owl和HPS均在贷款团中。该贷款明确围绕Zendesk的年度经常性收入将保持经常性这一假设进行结构化。在大约25倍EBITDA的情况下，杠杆只有在这一假设成立时才有意义。

到2027年中期，它不成立了。

AI代理已经自主处理客户服务近一年了。Zendesk所定义的类别（工单管理、路由、管理人工支持交互）已经被无需生成工单就能解决问题的系统所取代。贷款所基于的年度经常性收入不再是经常性的，它只是还没有流失的收入。

史上最大的ARR支持贷款变成了史上最大的私募信贷软件违约。每个信贷交易台都同时问了同一个问题：还有谁把周期性逆风伪装成了长期性逆风？

但共识最初的判断有一点是对的：这本应是可以承受的。

私募信贷不是2008年的银行业。整个架构被明确设计为避免强制出售。这些是封闭式基金，资本是锁定的。LP承诺了七到十年。没有存款人会挤兑，没有回购额度会被抽走。管理人可以持有受损资产，随时间逐步处理，等待恢复。痛苦，但可管理。系统应该弯曲而不断裂。

黑石、KKR和Apollo的高管引用了7-13%的软件资产敞口。可控。每份卖方报告和金融推特信贷账号都说同样的话：私募信贷有永久资本。它们可以吸收在杠杆银行中会引发爆炸的损失。

*永久资本。* 这个词出现在每次财报电话和旨在安抚投资者的信中。它成了一句咒语。而像大多数咒语一样，没有人注意到细节。它实际上意味着……

在过去十年中，大型另类资产管理公司收购了人寿保险公司，并将它们变成了融资工具。Apollo买了Athene。Brookfield买了American Equity。KKR拿了Global Atlantic。逻辑很优雅：年金存款提供了稳定的长久期负债基础。管理人将这些存款投资于他们发起的私募信贷，赚两次钱——保险端的利差和资管端的管理费。一个"费上加费"的永动机，在一个条件下完美运转。

*私募信贷必须是没问题的。*

损失打击了为持有非流动性资产对冲长久期义务而建造的资产负债表。应该使系统具有韧性的"永久资本"并不是什么抽象的耐心机构资金池和承担高级风险的成熟投资者。它是美国家庭的储蓄，"主街"的钱，以年金形式投资于现在正在违约的同一批PE支持的软件和科技债券。那些无法赎回的锁定资本是人寿保险投保人的钱，而那里的规则有点不同。

与银行系统相比，保险监管机构一直很温和——甚至可以说是自满——但这是一记警钟。对人寿保险公司的私募信贷集中度已经感到不安的他们，开始下调这些资产的风险资本处理方式。这迫使保险公司要么筹集资本，要么出售资产，在一个已经冻结的市场中，两者都无法以有吸引力的条件实现。

> 纽约州、爱荷华州监管机构对人寿保险公司持有的某些私下评级信贷收紧资本处理；预计NAIC指导将增加RBC因子并触发额外的SVO审查 | 路透社，2027年11月

当穆迪将Athene的财务实力评级列入负面展望时，Apollo的股票在两个交易日内下跌了22%。Brookfield、KKR和其他公司紧随其后。

接下来的情况只会更加复杂。这些公司不仅创建了它们的保险公司永动机，还建立了一个精心设计的离岸架构，旨在通过监管套利来最大化回报。美国保险公司签下年金，然后将风险让渡给它同样拥有的百慕大或开曼群岛关联再保险公司——设立该公司是为了利用更灵活的监管，允许对同样的资产持有更少的资本。该关联公司通过离岸SPV筹集外部资本，形成了一层新的交易对手，他们与保险公司一起投资于同一母公司的资管部门发起的私募信贷。

![The daisy chain structure](/images/2028gic/06-daisy-chain.jpeg)

评级机构——其中一些本身是PE所有的——在透明度方面并非楷模（这对几乎所有人来说都不意外）。不同公司关联到不同资产负债表的蜘蛛网在不透明性方面令人震惊。当底层贷款违约时，谁实际上承担了损失这个问题在实时中是真正无法回答的。

2027年11月的崩盘标志着认知从可能的普通周期性回调转变为更加令人不安的东西。*"一条白领生产力增长的关联押注菊花链"*——这是美联储主席Kevin Warsh在FOMC11月紧急会议上的说法。

看，造成危机的从来不是损失本身。而是认识到损失。还有另一个更大的、重要得多的金融领域，我们越来越害怕那种认识。

**抵押贷款问题**

> Zillow房价指数在旧金山同比下跌11%，西雅图下跌9%，奥斯汀下跌8%；房利美标记科技/金融就业占比超40%的邮政编码区域"早期逾期上升" | Zillow / 房利美，2028年6月

本月Zillow房价指数在旧金山同比下跌11%，西雅图下跌9%，奥斯汀下跌8%。这并不是唯一令人担忧的头条。上个月，房利美标记了来自大额抵押贷款密集邮编区域的更高早期逾期率——这些地区聚集着780+信用评分的借款人，通常被认为是"坚不可摧"的。

美国住宅抵押贷款市场约为13万亿美元。抵押贷款承销建立在一个基本假设上：借款人将在贷款期限内以大致当前的收入水平保持就业。对于大多数抵押贷款来说，是三十年。

白领就业危机以收入预期的持续转变威胁了这一假设。我们现在不得不问一个仅在三年前还显得荒谬的问题——*优质抵押贷款还安全吗？*

美国历史上每次抵押贷款危机都是由以下三件事之一驱动的：投机过度（向无力负担房屋的人放贷，如2008年）、利率冲击（利率上升使可调利率抵押贷款无法负担，如1980年代初期），或局部经济冲击（单一行业在单一地区崩溃，如1980年代德克萨斯的石油或2009年密歇根的汽车）。

这里以上都不适用。相关借款人不是次级贷款。他们的FICO评分为780。他们付了20%的首付。他们有清白的信用记录、稳定的就业记录，以及在发放时经过验证和记录的收入。他们是金融系统中每个风险模型都视为信用质量基石的借款人。

2008年，贷款在发放第一天就是坏的。2028年，贷款在发放第一天是好的。只是世界在贷款签订后……改变了。人们借的是他们再也无法相信的未来。

![Mortgage stress indicators](/images/2028gic/07-mortgage.png)

2027年，我们标记了隐形压力的早期迹象：HELOC（房屋净值信贷额度）提取、401(k)取款和信用卡债务飙升，而抵押贷款还款仍然正常。随着失业、招聘冻结和奖金削减，这些优质家庭的债务收入比翻倍。

他们仍然可以支付抵押贷款，但只能通过停止所有可选消费、耗尽储蓄和推迟任何房屋维护或改善。他们在技术上没有逾期，但距离困境只差一次冲击，而AI能力的发展轨迹表明这一冲击即将到来。然后我们看到旧金山、西雅图、曼哈顿和奥斯汀的逾期率开始飙升，尽管全国平均水平仍在历史正常范围内。

我们现在处于最严峻的阶段。当边际买家健康时，房价下跌是可管理的。这里，边际买家面临着同样的收入损害。

虽然担忧在积累，但我们还没有陷入全面的抵押贷款危机。逾期率有所上升，但仍远低于2008年的水平。真正的威胁是趋势。

![Delinquency trajectory](/images/2028gic/08-delinquency.png)

智能替代螺旋现在有两个金融加速器推动实体经济的衰退。

劳动力替代、抵押贷款担忧、私募市场动荡。每一个都在强化其他的。传统的政策工具（降息、量化宽松）可以解决金融引擎，但无法解决实体经济引擎，因为实体经济引擎不是由紧缩的金融条件驱动的。它是由AI使人类智能变得不那么稀缺和不那么有价值来驱动的。你可以把利率降到零，买下市场上所有的MBS和所有违约的软件杠杆收购债务……

这改变不了一个Claude代理可以以每月200美元的成本完成一个年薪18万美元的产品经理的工作这一事实。

如果这些担忧成为现实，抵押贷款市场将在今年下半年崩裂。在那种情景下，我们预计目前的股市回调最终将与全球金融危机（从峰值到谷底57%）相匹敌。这将使标普500降至约3500点——自2022年11月ChatGPT问世前一个月以来未见的水平。

明确的是，支撑13万亿美元住宅抵押贷款的收入假设已被结构性损害。不明确的是，政策能否在抵押贷款市场完全消化这意味着什么之前进行干预。我们抱有希望，但我们无法否认不乐观的理由。

### 与时间的战斗

第一个负反馈循环在实体经济中：AI能力提升，工资支出缩减，消费疲软，利润收紧，公司购买更多能力，能力提升。然后它转变为金融问题：收入损害冲击了抵押贷款，银行损失收紧了信贷，财富效应崩裂，反馈循环加速。而这两者都因政府不充分的政策应对而加剧——坦率地说，政府显得很困惑。

![Policy response timeline](/images/2028gic/09-policy.png)

这个系统不是为这样的危机设计的。联邦政府的收入基础本质上是对人类时间的征税。人们工作，企业支付他们工资，政府抽取一部分。个人所得税和工资税是正常年份收入的脊梁。

截至今年第一季度，联邦收入比CBO基线预测低12%。工资税收入在下降，因为更少的人以之前的薪酬水平就业。所得税收入在下降，因为正在赚取的收入在结构上更低。生产率在飙升，但收益流向了资本和算力，而非劳动力。

劳动力在GDP中的份额从1974年的64%下降到2024年的56%，四十年的渐进下滑由全球化、自动化和工人议价能力的持续侵蚀所驱动。在AI开始指数级改进后的四年里，这一比例降至46%。有记录以来的最剧烈下降。

![Labor's share of GDP](/images/2028gic/10-labor-share.png)

产出仍然在那里。但它不再通过家庭流回企业，这意味着它也不再通过国税局流通。循环流正在断裂，而政府被期望介入修复。

与每次经济衰退一样，支出在收入下降的同时上升。不同的是，这次的支出压力不是周期性的。自动稳定器是为临时性失业设计的，而非结构性替代。系统在支付假设工人将被重新吸收的福利。许多人不会，至少不会以接近之前的工资水平。新冠期间，政府欣然接受了15%的赤字，但那被理解为是暂时的。今天需要政府支持的人不是被他们会康复的大流行病击中的。他们被一项持续改进的技术所取代。

**政府需要在正好从家庭收取更少税收的时刻，向家庭转移更多的钱。**

美国不会违约。它印刷自己使用的货币，同一种货币也用于偿还借款人。但这种压力已在其他地方显现。市政债券在年初至今的表现中显示出令人担忧的分化迹象。没有所得税的州还可以，但依赖所得税的州（主要是蓝色州）发行的一般义务市政债券开始计入一些违约风险。政客们迅速注意到了这一点，围绕谁得到救助的辩论已经沿着党派路线展开。

值得肯定的是，政府较早认识到了危机的结构性质，并开始考虑两党提案，他们称之为"过渡经济法案"：一个向被取代工人进行直接转移支付的框架，资金来源是赤字支出和拟议的AI推理算力税的组合。

桌面上最激进的提案走得更远。"共享AI繁荣法案"将在智能基础设施的回报上建立公共索偿权，介于主权财富基金和AI生成产出的版税之间，股息用于资助家庭转移支付。私营部门的游说者已经在媒体上充斥着关于滑坡效应的警告。

讨论背后的政治可悲地可预测，被表演和边缘博弈所加剧。右派将转移支付和再分配称为马克思主义，并警告对算力征税会将领先地位拱手让给中国。左派警告说，由在位者帮助起草的税收会变成另一种形式的监管俘获。财政鹰派指出不可持续的赤字。鸽派指出全球金融危机后过早紧缩的前车之鉴。分歧只在今年总统大选前夕不断加剧。

在政客们争吵的时候，社会结构的瓦解速度超过了立法程序的推进速度。

占领硅谷运动已成为更广泛不满的标志。上个月，示威者封锁了Anthropic和OpenAI在旧金山办公室的入口，持续了整整三周。他们的人数在增长，示威活动获得的媒体报道比引发它们的失业数据更多。

很难想象公众会比全球金融危机后对银行家更仇恨任何人，但AI实验室正在追赶。而且，从大众的角度来看，这是有充分理由的。它们的创始人和早期投资者以使镀金时代相形见绌的速度积累了财富。生产率繁荣的收益几乎全部归于算力的拥有者和运行在其上的实验室的股东，这将美国的不平等放大到了前所未有的水平。

每一方都有自己的反派，但真正的反派是时间。

AI能力的进化速度超过了机构的适应速度。政策应对以意识形态的节奏推进，而非以现实的节奏。如果政府不尽快就问题的本质达成共识，反馈循环将为他们书写下一章。

### 智能溢价的瓦解

在整个现代经济史上，人类智能一直是稀缺投入。资本是充裕的（或至少是可复制的）。自然资源是有限的但可替代的。技术的改进速度足够慢，人类可以适应。智能——分析、决策、创造、说服和协调的能力——是唯一无法大规模复制的东西。

人类智能的内在溢价源于其稀缺性。我们经济中的每一个机构，从劳动力市场到抵押贷款市场再到税法，都是为这一假设成立的世界而设计的。

我们现在正在经历这一溢价的瓦解。机器智能现在是人类智能在越来越多任务上的有能力且快速改进的替代品。为稀缺的人类头脑世界优化了数十年的金融系统正在重新定价。这种重新定价是痛苦的、无序的，而且远未完成。

但重新定价不等于崩溃。

经济可以找到新的均衡。到达那里是少数只有人类才能完成的任务之一。我们需要正确地做到这一点。

这是历史上第一次，经济中最具生产力的资产产生了更少而非更多的工作岗位。没有人的框架适用，因为没有一个是为稀缺投入变得充裕的世界设计的。所以我们必须建立新的框架。**我们是否能及时建立它们，是唯一重要的问题。**

*但你不是在2028年6月读这篇文章。你是在2026年2月读的。*

*标普500接近历史高点。负反馈循环尚未开始。我们确信其中一些情景不会实现。我们同样确信，机器智能将继续加速。人类智能的溢价将收窄。*

*作为投资者，我们仍有时间评估我们的投资组合中有多少是建立在无法存活到这个十年结束的假设之上的。作为一个社会，我们仍有时间主动出击。*

*金丝雀还活着。*
