## English

Anthropic is partnering with Teach For All to bring AI tools and training to educators in 63 countries. Through the AI Literacy & Creator Collective (LCC), more than 100,000 teachers and alumni across Teach For All's network—which serves more than 1.5 million students—will have the opportunity to develop AI fluency and adapt Claude to serve real classroom needs.

Building on the approach pioneered by Teach For America, Teach For All is a global network of independent organizations working to expand educational opportunity. Over the past 15 years, it has grown into one of the world's largest and most respected communities of educators serving students in under-resourced schools.

### Built on Shared Learning

What makes this partnership distinctive is its approach. Teachers are positioned not as passive consumers of AI tools, but as co-architects shaping how AI develops. Through the AI LCC, Anthropic provides access to Claude, while educators provide on-the-ground feedback to inform how the product evolves.

Wendy Kopp, CEO of Teach For All, stated: "For AI to reach its potential to make education more equitable, teachers need to be the ones shaping how it's used and providing input on how it's designed."

### What Teachers Are Building

One teacher in Liberia, new to AI, attended the AI LCC's live trainings on AI fluency. Within weeks, he had built an interactive climate education curriculum for Liberian schools using Claude Artifacts.

In Bangladesh, a teacher working with Grade 6 and 7 students—over half of whom struggled with basic numeracy—built a gamified math learning app complete with boss battles, a leaderboard, and XP rewards.

The pattern is consistent across the network: teachers who know their students best can now build tools tailored to them.

### How the AI Literacy and Creator Collective Works

The collective operates through three interconnected programs.

The AI Fluency Learning Series consists of six live episodes covering AI fluency, Claude capabilities, and practical classroom applications. Over 530 educators attended the first series in November 2025.

Claude Connect is the community's ongoing learning hub—more than 1,000 educators representing 60+ countries exchanging prompts, use cases, and discoveries through daily peer-to-peer conversation.

Claude Lab is for educators interested in going further. This innovation space gives teachers Claude Pro access to test practical implementations with advanced features. Within four days of announcing the program, over 200 applications were received.

### Building on Anthropic's Education Work

This partnership builds on Anthropic's growing work with educators and governments worldwide. In Iceland, Anthropic launched one of the world's first comprehensive national AI education pilots. In Rwanda, Anthropic partnered with the government and ALX to bring AI education to hundreds of thousands of learners across Africa.

### Looking Forward

As AI transforms how knowledge is created and shared, teachers will be essential guides for students navigating this transition. The commitment is ensuring that educators in every community, not just the most well-resourced, can shape and benefit from AI's potential.

## 中文翻译

Anthropic 正与 Teach For All 合作，为 63 个国家的教育工作者提供 AI 工具和培训。通过 AI 素养与创造者集体 (LCC)，Teach For All 网络中超过 10 万名教师和校友——该网络服务超过 150 万名学生——将有机会发展 AI 素养并调整 Claude 以满足真实的课堂需求。

在 Teach For America 开创的方法基础上，Teach For All 是一个致力于扩大教育机会的独立组织全球网络。在过去 15 年中，它已发展成为世界上最大、最受尊敬的教育工作者社区之一，服务于资源不足学校的学生。

### 建立在共同学习之上

使这一合作伙伴关系与众不同的是其方法。教师不是 AI 工具的被动消费者，而是塑造 AI 发展的共同设计师。通过 AI LCC，Anthropic 提供 Claude 的访问权限，而教育工作者则提供实地反馈以指导产品的发展。

Teach For All CEO Wendy Kopp 表示："要让 AI 实现使教育更公平的潜力，教师需要成为塑造其使用方式并为其设计提供意见的人。"

### 教师们正在构建什么

利比里亚的一位 AI 新手教师参加了 AI LCC 的 AI 素养在线培训。几周内，他就使用 Claude Artifacts 为利比里亚学校构建了一套互动式气候教育课程。

在孟加拉国，一位与六年级和七年级学生合作的教师——其中一半以上在基本数学方面存在困难——构建了一个游戏化的数学学习应用，配有 Boss 战、排行榜和经验值奖励。

这一模式在整个网络中保持一致：最了解学生的教师现在可以构建量身定制的工具。

### AI 素养与创造者集体如何运作

该集体通过三个相互关联的项目运作。

AI 素养学习系列包含六个在线课程，涵盖 AI 素养、Claude 能力和实用的课堂应用。2025 年 11 月的第一个系列有超过 530 名教育工作者参加。

Claude Connect 是社区的持续学习中心——超过 1,000 名代表 60 多个国家的教育工作者通过每日的点对点对话交流提示、用例和发现。

Claude Lab 面向有兴趣深入学习的教育工作者。这个创新空间为教师提供 Claude Pro 访问权限，以测试具有高级功能的实际实施。在宣布该项目的四天内，收到了 200 多份申请。

### 展望未来

随着 AI 改变知识创造和共享的方式，教师将成为学生过渡的重要向导。承诺是确保每个社区的教育工作者——而不仅仅是资源最丰富的——都能塑造并受益于 AI 的潜力。
